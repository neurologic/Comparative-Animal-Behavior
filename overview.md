## Observation of Behavior (Ethogram)

- [Ethogram of operating room behavior.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs12160-016-9773-0)
- Jeanne Altmann [Observational study of behavior: Sampling Methods](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4533591?seq=1) Behaviour
Vol. 49, No. 3/4, pp. 227-267 (1974)

## Behavioral Diversity

:::{note}
difference between "actions" and behavior when think about many behaviors (that are often comprised of sets of actions occurring over longer timescales).
:::

Can I get a list of "all behaviors" from the literature?

### Behavioral Style

- Social/Solitary
- Continuous/Cyclic

### Complex Behavior Patterns

- Obtaining calories
- Mating and Bonding
- Competing
- Defense
- Caring for offspring
- Communication
- Hibernating/Migrating


### Skills needed

- Navigation

## Levels of Analysis (Tinbergen)

1. Phylogeny
2. Evolutionary (Adaptive Selection)
3. Neural and Genetic (essential building blocks)
4. Hormonal and Developmental (flexibility, modulation, seasonality, etc)

[Reed Biol website examples](https://www.reed.edu/biology/courses/BIO342/2016_pages/Webs2016.html)

Tinbergen provided a framework for integrative studies into behaviour. Here, he suggested that to fully comprehend how and why a trait evolves, we must address ‘Four questions’ regarding: (i) the mechanisms that facilitate the trait, (ii) the developmental environment that alters expression of the trait, (iii) the fitness consequences of a trait, and (iv) the similarities and differences of the trait across a phylogeny

## Understanding Behavior

> Working through select examples from behavioral diversity to practice thinking about all levels of explanation for behavior in a comparative approach. Examples of techniques implemented in Animal Behavior studies at all levels. 

### Competition and Defense.
- Conflict
- Territoriality

- Escape behavior
- Collective Defense
