# Ethical Considerations for Animal Use

The following summary is from Box 2.2 of the *Guide to Research Techniques in Neuroscience*[^neuro-techniques-guide].

Using animal models in biological research is necessary to make conclusions
about a fully functional, living organism. However, using animals is also a privilege,
and scientists deciding to use animal models must consider many ethical
considerations. These ethical concerns are not solely the responsibility of the individual
scientist; the use of animals must also be justified to animal oversight
committees that exist to maintain the welfare of research animals. Each institution
has an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that must approve
protocols involving animals and ensure that the research is justified. Furthermore,
granting agencies and many scientific journals now require that scientists state that
all animal protocols are approved by their institution’s IACUC.
When using animals in experiments, distress must be minimized and the potential
benefits to humans must be maximized.   

Animal welfare guidelines
throughout the world are based on the principles proposed by Russell and Burch in
The Principles of Humane Experimental Research (1959), commonly referred to as
the three Rs:  

**Replacement**: If there is any way to do the research without using animals, it
should be done. This includes using computational modeling and cell culture
methods. In the case of behavioral research, modeling is obviously impossible
without actually performing the behavioral task. However, another component
of replacement is the use of “less-sentient” animal species: choosing to study
invertebrates rather than vertebrates, or mice rather than monkeys, etc.  

**Reduction**: Use the minimum number of animals to obtain scientifically valid
data. If possible, use the same animals for multiple experiments. Also, investigators
should perform mathematical analyses to determine the minimum
number of animals required to provide enough statistical power to obtain
significant results.  

**Refinement**: Procedures must minimize distress and pain and enhance animal
well-being. This guideline is also important for the consistency and interpretability
of experimental results. For example, stress has numerous effects on
physiology that can confound results.  

Following these guidelines is standard practice for developing animal protocols
and justifying research goals.
