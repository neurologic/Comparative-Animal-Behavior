:::{admonition} Why?
Genes exert their effects on behavior via the proteins and protein expression that they encode. Importantly, behavior is a complex trait effected by many genes in concert, which has implications for how the genetic mechanisms of behavior are studied.

## Genetics Primer

Just to remind you of the sorts of molecules we are thinking about today.

### Proteins

The proteins comprising an animal's body are essential material to all behavioral phenotypes. Proteins provide the physical form of an animal, which grants unique affordances to different animals. Proteins also dictate the functional properties of an animal's nervous system, which orchestrates the actions of behavior directly.

The mRNA sequence is a copy of the DNA sequence (with a slight modification of bases). Ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm read out mRNA and, based on mRNA sequence, construct a string of amino acid chains that make up the synthesized protein. Therefore, genes ultimately "code for" protein structure.

## Sexual Reproduction: mixing things up

An animal's behavior is comprised of many phenotypes. For example, one person might: participate in a lot of sports, spend a lot of their time socializing with other people, and read a lot; while another person might: not do any sports, spend most of their time alone, and write a lot. Let's consider that these two people mated. If all of their offspring were either "just like one parent" or "just like the other parent", then it might infer that the genes underlying all three of these behaviors are *linked*. 

:::{glossary}

genetic linkage
 the tendency of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction.
 
::: 

In animal behavior, we often think of multi-trait phenotypes as *personalities* or *syndromes*. The ability of traits to be correlated with each other depends on the mechanisms of heritability and sexual reproduction. 

### Independent Assortment

In sexual reproduction, gametes are produced from the genome of a parent. For each chromosome (DNA strand), each gamete carries one of the two parental versions. During meiosis (before the pairs of parental chromosomes are reduced to individual chromosomes), chromosome pairs line up with random orientation across the midline. Therefore, genes on separate chromosomes *assort independently* - ie. they ***get randomly mixed up***. Importantly, *independent assortment* results in suites of traits that are ***uncorrelated*** across individuals (in otherwords, individuals each get a random mix of phenotype possibilities... at least for phenotypes controlled by genes on separate chromosomes).  

:::{figure-md} Making-Gametes-KhanAcademy
:class: figure

<img src="/images/Making-Gametes-KhanAcademy.png" alt="fishy" width="500px">

The homologues of each chromosome pair separate in the first stage of meiosis. In this process, which side the male parent and female parent chromosomes of each pair go to is random. When we are following two genes, this results in four types of gametes that are produced with equal frequency (ie. randomly mixed). Image from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/heredity/non-mendelian-genetics/a/linkage-mapping)

:::

### Recombination

Even genes on the same chromosome can get mixed up. At the very beginning of meiosis, homologous chromosomes randomly exchange matching fragments of DNA during ***crossover*** events.

:::{figure-md} Recombination-KhanAcademy
:class: figure

<img src="/images/Recombination-KhanAcademy.png" alt="fishy" width="500px">

Cartoon of *recombination* in which homologous chromosomes "cross over" and exchange DNA fragments. Image from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/heredity/non-mendelian-genetics/a/linkage-mapping)
:::

Independent assortment and recombination both contribute the the genetic variation among offspring from a parental generation (ie, compare the resulting allele composition of gametes between Figure 55 and 56).

### Gene-Phenotype Trends

The biochemistry of heritability through sexual reproduction leads to relationships between:
1. the number of genes (or linked genes) and the distribution of phenotypes 
2. genetic linkage and correlations among different phenotypes

These two predictable associations scaffold popular approaches to studying the genetic mechanisms of animal behavior. Figure 57 shows these relationships in more detail.

:::{figure} /images/gene-phenotype-trends.png
:width: 500

Many animals burrow, but different species exhibit different types of burrowing behavior. Consider three main features to burrowing behavior that can be measured: tunnel length (X), tunnel depth (Y), and the presence of an escape tunnel (Z). Maybe one species digs *short, shallow tunnels with no escape* while another species digs *long, deep tunnels with an escape*. There are many different ***genetic architectures*** (ie. genotype patterns) that could explain these species differences. Four examples are given: one ***monogenic*** architecture and three ***polygenic*** architectures. Each of these different genetic architectures would yield different phenotype distribution and correlation if the two species were interbred. ***The results of a genetic cross can therefore be used to infer basic features of the genetic architecture for behavior***.

Now, let's examine some ***genetic mechanistic questions***. Ultimately, we want to identify genes that control burrowing behavior (ie. ***what genes explain phenotype variation in the behavior across animals/species***). But first, we need to know ***if genes control the behavior at all***. In other words, are burrowing behavior phenotypes ***inherited genetically or learned culturally***? Research using *P. maniculatus* and *P. polionotus* provide a great example of how to investigate these questions[^burrowing-behav-advantages]. 

[^burrowing-behav-advantages]: Several features of Peromyscus burrowing behavior make it a well-suited system for tackling how genetic change leads to complex behavioral change. 
    - Burrowing behavior is largely innate.
    - A burrow is a behavioral product (“extended phenotype”) that can be measured like a morphological trait. 
    - Burrowing behavior has diverged significantly between two interfertile sister species, P. maniculatus and P. polionotus.

#### Cross Fostering


To **cross-foster** animals, you rear offspring from animals exhibiting one phenotype for a trait with parents exhibiting another phenotype. The phenotype of cross-fostered offspring are then compared with the phenotype of offspring raised by biological parents. Cross-fostering experiments isolate pre-natal from post-natal factors effecting behavior.

### What Genes? 

:::{index} genetic cross
:::

Once it has been determined that a behavior is inherited, there are three commonly used methods for investigating *what* genes control it: *genetic cross*, *forward genetics*, *reverse genetics*. 

#### 1: Genetic Cross

Genetic crosses afford powerful insight into the genetic basis of phenotypic variation (as you examined in Figure 61). Phenotype *heritability patterns* are a useful tool for inferring the number of and relationship among genes contributing to complex behavioral phenotyps. 

Burrowing behavior has diverged significantly between two interfertile sister species, P. maniculatus and P. polionotus. Because they are interfertile, they can be genetically *crossed* (ie. mated).

blue). F1 hybrids, which produce P. polionotus-like burrows, are then backcrossed to P. maniculatus. The resultant backcross generation (BC) shows a range of burrow architectures: burrows that resemble the parents (short entrance tunnel without
an escape tunnel, and long entrance tunnel with an escape tunnel) as well as new architectures (short entrance tunnel with an escape tunnel, and long entrance tunnel without an escape).[^Hu-Hoekstra-2017]

:::{index} forward genetics
:::
#### 2: Forward Genetics

The identification of genomic regions associated with behavioral phenotypes is a first step in the identification of causal genes responsible for variation in a naturally evolved, complex behavior. 

Gregor Mendel was either clever or lucky enough to study traits of simple inheritance in his pea plants; however, many phenotypes of interest to modern geneticists are complex (***quantitative***). Understanding the genetic basis of quantitative traits requires a combination of modern molecular genetic techniques and powerful statistical methods.

**Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping** is a widely used statistical tool for this purpose. QTL mapping simply involves ***finding an association between a genetic marker and a phenotype*** that can be measured. ***The genetic marker contains information about which parental genome that section of chromosome came from***. 

:::{figure} /images/QTL-mapping-plants.png
:width: 350

In QTL mapping, the parental alleles are shuffled by *genetically crossing* parents and progeny to create a large ***mapping population***.[^Mauricio-2001] In this example, genetic material from Parent 2 (blue) at the location of the black arrow seems associated with low trichome density. 
:::

:::{figure} /images/QTL-mapping-plants-regression.png
:width: 300

The phenotype and the ***multilocus*** genotype of each individual in the mapping population are measured. *Markers* along the genome that are specific to each parental genotype are targetted for analysis. There are several different statistical techniques available for QTL mapping. Essentially, it is a regression or correlation. In this example, there is a correlation between genotype and phenotype at this marker location (A)[^Mauricio-2001].  
:::

To localize the causal regions for burrowing behavior in the genome, hybrid animals from a large genetic cross of *P. maniculatus* and *P. polionotus* were assayed for burrowing behavior and then genotyped. QTL mapping techniques were used to identify regions that explain phenotypic variation in the hybrid animals.

:::{index} reverse genetics
:::

#### 3: Reverse Genetics

For a long time, it was thought that animal behaviors are too complex to be immediately determined by genetic factors. For example, male courtship behavior in Drosophila is a stereotyped sequence of FAPs in which a male follows a female, taps the female, sings a song by vibrating one wing, licks the female’s genitalia and curls the abdomen to attempt copulation. Male courtship behavior is obviously complex, however, it was one of the first behaviors found to be specified by a single gene. 

Using a *reverse genetic* approach, Demir and Diskson (2005)[^fruitless-dickson] showed that the fruitless gene is transcribed and translated differently in male and female flies. For a reverse genetic approach, they manipulated the genome directly. Splicing the fruitless gene in a "male" way (ie. a targeted manipulation of the suspected gene of interest), ***induced*** male courtship behavior in female flies. Male homozygous fruitless mutants had normal genitalia but did not exhibit courtship behavior toward female flies. 

[^fruitless-dickson]: [Ebru Demir and Barry J. Dickson (2005) fruitless Splicing Specifies Male Courtship Behavior in Drosophila. Cell 121(5)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.027)

Even though many behaviors are *polygenic* (effected by multiple genes), a reverse genetic approach can still yield insight. 


## Case Study: Genetics of Monogamy

Monogamy and promiscuity are two common *phenotypes* for mating behavior. 

:::{glossary}

monogamy
 one reproductive partner 

promiscuity
 several reproductive partners at a time

::: 

Thomas Insel, head of the National Institute of Mental Health and a pioneer in vole studies, describes voles as "an extraordinary gift to science" in which nature has performed an experiment with which we can ask the question: "what was modified genetically in the brain to get this difference in behavior?" In this case, mating behavior.
Unlike most rodents, many voles are monogamous, forming bonds that last long after mating (often for life) and cohabitating more or less permanently in subterranean dens. Prarie voles are one of these robustly monogamous species. Interestingly, prairie voles have near-identical cousins called montane voles that do not form social bonds after mating. 

The results of one of the first genetic experiments in montane and prarie voles are shown in Figure 69.

Young et al 1999 [^Young1999] did not find differences in the protein sequence of the V1a receptor gene. Instead, they found differences in the "microsatellite repeats" in the region of the genome read before the gene itself gets read. Although the V1a-R protein iteself is nearly identical between these two species, the protein ends up located in different parts of the brain. Microsatellite repeats do not effect the structure of a protein, but rather regulate where and when it is expressed (transcribed and translated).  

We can return to this example when we talk about mating behavior.
