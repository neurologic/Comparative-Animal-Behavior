Use the ***Intro*** section of the following simulation to examine the interaction between selection pressures and the phenotypic distribution of a population. Focus on the phenotypes, phenotype frequencies, and selection pressures. Do not focus on the issues of dominant/recessive alleles and allele frequency. 

Once you start the simulation, *add a mate* and introduce a dominant mutation. Let the populaton grow for 2-3 generations before manipulationg any of the other factors in the simulation. Then experiment with different available manipulations and take notes on the results you observe across manipulations that you try.

## Selective Pressure

:::{admonition} Assumptions
A fundamental assumption in the contemporary study of animal behaivor, is that behavior is an adaptation to changing needs and a changing environment that maximizes evolutionary fitness[^fitness] (it evolves by natural selection). Another key assumption is that behavioral phenotypes are *heritable* across generations (that there is a strong *genetic* component, though we won't get into any actual genetics yet)[^heritability].
:::

[^fitness]: In other words, behavior can convey reproductive advantage. We won't by more explicit about fitness from the perspective of alleles themselves until we have reviewed Genetics as a class. When we talk about fitness, we can think about how well an animal survives. When we talk about phenotypes as adaptations and their evolution, we ultimately do need to think about fitness in terms of the frequencies of gene alleles that give rise to those phenotypes. Allele frequency over generations depends little on the survivability of an individual animal, and more on how much that animal reproduces (and how well its offspring reproduce).

[^heritability]: If an individual has an advantageous trait, then it is more likely to reproduce. Since traits pass from parents to offspring (*heritability*), then offspring are likely to inherit advantageous
traits. Over time, advantageous traits become more common in a population.


## Case Study on adaptation: exploitation of behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns that are stereotyped (ie. FAPs) are, by definition, predictable. As you know from [experiments that test for sign stimuli of FAPs](FAPs-sign-stimuli), if a sign stimulus is encountered, then the FAP will be released, regardless of the source of that sign stimulus[^unless-inhibited]. This *sign stimulus : FAP* pair can be thought of as a code. *Code breaking* describes "inappropriate" release of an FAP by another animal. 

[^unless-inhibited]: There are many examples of the effect of a sign stimulus being inhibited by a concurrent, but different, stimulus. The effects of sign stimuli can also be enhanced by additional stimuli. 

In solitary ground nesting bee species (that includes the bee families: Andrenidae, Apidae, Colletidae, and Halictidae), females dig nests in which they deposit and provision their fertilized eggs with pollen after mating[^Neff-2008].

Males desperately seek females to mate with. They patrol the nesting aggregation in large numbers and form [‘mating balls’ in which multiple males grapple with each other and attempt to pair up with the female](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/jinsectscience/18/4/10.1093_jisesa_iey083/2/iey083_suppl_supplementary_online_resource_4.mp4?Expires=1662209471&Signature=Xcqvmc4xBv4Sb6dRayNr5imKMWW3S4SblcADJfI~r04kU0sOjtsHy-TaBWHqoOAB3D7ESd9awMmnwbeNEprqywMoOUhhT~mRRMUKctFxEaoN8smR953C1a2qsmI~-u3MNdDB0jfjwXiRBIASJKyIKVD8DTDLyPYmHq6k4cFGkPz2JUwim-maUvWUrV5SszZXDa5E4hMvIqUCr-UirLTNbddge5STeot3Yf2VR4cwvW1FoNTmpEqTzMVYDmrdJxP9DWimVicj6dI1xfC-O~D2fYiqzXuyklY~0NF6MAGJVMt1b1rYyJcKbYseuqoRXVT90VTnA50rvEysdnWmpvS6qw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)[^entomology-today][^Russell2018]. The mating sequence of males comprises several actions that are organized according to stereotyped transition probabilities[^Russell2018].

Males also *mate* with aggregates of larval blister beetles. During attempted copulation, the larvae hitch a ride on the male. When the male bee mates with a female bee, the larvae can transfer to the female and hitch a ride back to the female's nest. The larvae are parasitic and feed off of the provisions in the nest that were intended for the bee larvae.

## Evolutionary Models

:::{admonition} Why?
Ultimately, to *understand* a behavioral phenotype from an evolutionary perspective means to be able to predict phenotypes of extant species. This involves both correctly identifying the adaptive role that the behavior plays and the selective pressures that exert evolutionary force on the behavior.
Mathematical models are abstractions that strive to have predictive power (with varying degrees of precision). Models represent a scientist's best informed guess as to the identity and function of important variables and the ways these variables interact with each other.
:::

We will start with two common types of evolutionary models: [Optimality Theory](optimality-theory) and [Game Theory](game-theory)

:::{index} optimality theory
:::

(optimality-theory)=
### Optimality Theory

Remember observing and quantifying [vigilance behavior](../observation-and-analysis/observation)? From an evolutionary perspective, let's think about how to understand vigilance behavior using an optimality theory model. 

---
> ⏳ 10

Consider the two alternative phenotypes: *vigilant* and *not vigilant*.  
Let's start by including two factors in the model:
- $t$ = time foraging (searching for and eating food)
- $e$ = probability of escaping a predator 

***Q: In terms of time foraging and probability of escape from predation, what is the 'benefit' of being vigilant comparted to being not vigilant?***

***Q: In terms of time foraging and probability of escape from predation, what is the 'cost' of being vigilant comparted to being not vigilant?***

***Q: In terms of time foraging and probability of escape from predation, what is the 'benefit' of being not vigilant comparted to being vigilant?***

***Q: In terms of time foraging and probability of escape from predation, what is the 'cost' of being not vigilant comparted to being vigilant?***

We often come across evolutionary explanations in terms of *costs* and *benefits*. As you see from this example, these terms are relative. Therefore, it is more generalizable to talk in terms of *factors* rather than costs or benefits per se.

Let's formalize our first optimality theory model in terms of a mathematical expression for $F$, the net fitness of a phenotype.

$$
  F = t + e
$$

If there are multiple possible phenotypes (in this case vigilant or not vigilant), then the phenotype that confers greater total fitness to the animal will be favored by natural selection. Therefore, the solution to an optimality model is to find the point (phenotype) where net fitness ($F$) is maximized.

***Q: Would the vigilant phenotype or the not vigilant phenotype have a higher value of $t$?***

***Q: Would the vigilant phenotype or the not vigilant phenotype have a higher value of $e$?***

***Q: Given this information, can you determine which phenotype has a higher net fitness? Choose some arbitrary (but logical) values for the variables $t$ and $e$ in your model***

***Q: What kinds of issues are you encountering in using the model to predict which phenotype is more fit?***

Consider how environments can differ. Do all environments have the same amount or quality of food? What about predators? As you experienced in the [Natural Selection Simulation](#natural-selection-simulation), environments exert selective pressure on phenotypes, which means that changing environments can change the relative fitness of two phenotypes.  
Let's account for the effect of environment by adding two new variables to the model: 
- $q$ = the quality or amount of food available
- $p$ = the number of predators

Consider this revised formulation of the model 

$$
  F = q*t + p*e
$$

***Q: Based on this revised model, in an environment with a lot of predators and low food quality, which phenotype would you predict to be favored by natural selection?***

***Q: Does this revision of the model change your ability to solve the model?***

:::{index} game theory
:::

(game-theory)=
### Game theory

There are many cases where the fitness associated with a particular behavior depends on what others are doing. Thus, what is best will depend on what everyone else in the population is doing (and therefore on the likelihood of certain types of interactions with certain types of fitness consequences). Game theory is like optimality theory in many ways, but it takes into account *selective pressure from conspecifics* and *the proportion in which other phenotypes exist*. 

---
> ⏳ 15

Let's practice with a common model for variation in conflict resolution phenotypes: *fighter* and *pacifist*. 

:::{admonition} Fighter-Pacifist model
*Fighters* always fight when challenged until the resource is won. In the simplest case, each fighter has a 50% chance of winning the resource. 
*Pacifists* try to share the resource, but back down immediately when challenged with a fight (they don't engage in any fighting, which means they give up the resource completely).  
In the model, let's include two factors that can contribute to an animal's fitness: the *resource* and a *fight*: 
- $v$ = the energy gained by obtaining the limited resource
- $c$ = the damage done by losing a fight over a resource
:::

What happens when each set of behavioral strategies interact?  

:::{admonition} Play it out 
Choose two people from the group to be the 'players'. Players act out the game from the perspective of the behavioral *strategies*.  
Choose one person from the group to be the moderator. The moderator starts each round.

**Condition 1: Pacifists** 
Each player represents the pacifist behavior.  
Choose one player to be the 'focal' player (the one whose fitness gets tallied in the end).  

The moderator places one blue pen on the table. This pen is the 'resource' and it is worth +2 units of fitness.  
When the moderator says *go*, both players interact over the resource. Decide how the resource will be allocated according to the 'pacifist' behavior.
After the resource has been allocated, the focal player tallies their net change in fitness after the encounter.  

The moderator places the blue pen back on the table and the interaction repeats (trial \#2) when the moderator says *go*.  
Repeat the interaction for 10 trials total (tallying the focal player's change in net fitness after every encounter)

**Condition 2: Fighters**
Each player represents the fighter behavior.  
Choose one player to be the 'focal' player (the one whose fitness gets tallied in the end).  

The moderator places one blue pen on the table. This pen is the 'resource' and it is worth +2 units of fitness.  
The moderator places one red pen on the table. This pen is the consequence of losing a figth and it is worth -1 unit of fitness.

When the moderator says *go*, both players interact over the resource. Decide how the resource and consequence will be allocated according to the 'fighter' behavior (how will you decide who wins the fight on each trial? ...remember that each fighter has a 50% chance of winning the resource).
After the resource and consequence have been allocated, the focal player tallies their net change in fitness after the encounter (the blue pen is worth +2 and the red pen is worth -1).

:::{admonition} Play it out 
**Condition 2: Pacifist among fighters**
The focal player represents the pacifist behavior. 
The other player represents the fighter behavior.  

The moderator places one blue pen on the table. This pen is the 'resource' and it is worth +2 units of fitness.  
The moderator places one red pen on the table. This pen is the consequence of losing a figth and it is worth -1 unit of fitness.

When the moderator says *go*, both players interact over the resource. Decide how the resource and consequence will be allocated according to the 'pacifist' behavior encountering a 'fighter' behavior (for example, what happens to the red pen?). After the resource and consequence have been allocated, the focal player tallies their net change in fitness after the encounter (the blue pen is worth +2 and the red pen is worth -1).  
:::

***Q: Make a table that shows the average net fitness (per trial) of each focal behavioral strategy in each behavioral context that you tested.***

> ⏳ 10

The game theory model that you have been playing out can be summarized in general terms according to the following equations.

|  | In a population of fighters | In a population of pacifists |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Average net fitness for a fighter** | ${v-c}/2$ | $v$ |
| **Average net fitness for a pacifist** | 0 | $v/2$ |

After a fighter encounters another fighter, its fitness changes by $ F = v $ if it wins but $ F = -c $ if it loses. Since it wins 1/2 the time, the average fitness is $v/2 - c/2$.
After a pacifist encounters another pacifist, its fitness changes by $ F = v/2 $ because they share the resource.
Fighters always gain the resource against pacifists and do so without a fight, which means pacifists end up with nothing against fighters.

The conditions that you acted out were: $v=2$ and $c=1$.  

***Q: Under the conditions that you acted out, use the model equations to determine which strategy has a greater net fitness in a population of all fighters.***

***Q: Under the conditions that you acted out, use the model equations to determine which strategy has a greater net fitness in a population of all pacifists.***

Consider a new set of conditions. For example, what about an environment in which there are more predators. In this environment, the cost of losing a fight is greater because if you are injured, you have a high probability of being eaten by a predator. Consider that $v=2$ and $c=3$.  

***Q: In this different environment, where $v=2$ and $c=3$, which strategy has a greater net fitness in a population of all fighters?***

***Q: In this different environment, where $v=2$ and $c=3$, which strategy has a greater net fitness in a population of all pacifists?***
