## Selective Pressure

:::{admonition} Assumptions
In the contemporary study of animal behaivor, an assumption is that behavior is an adaptation to changing needs and a changing environment that maximizes evolutionary fitness[^fitness]. Another key assumption is that behavioral phenotypes are *heritable* across generations (that there is a strong *genetic* component, though we won't get into any actual genetics yet)[^heritability].
:::

[^fitness]: In other words, behavior can convey reproductive advantage. We won't by more explicit about fitness from the perspective of alleles themselves until we have reviewed Genetics as a class. When we talk about fitness, we can think about how well an animal survives. When we talk about phenotypes as adaptations and their evolution, we ultimately do need to think about fitness in terms of the frequencies of gene alleles that give rise to those phenotypes. Allele frequency over generations depends little on the survivability of an individual animal, and more on how much that animal reproduces (and how well its offspring reproduce).

[^heritability]: If an individual has an advantageous trait, then it is more likely to reproduce. Since traits pass from parents to offspring (*heritability*), then offspring are likely to inherit advantageous
traits. Over time, advantageous traits become more common in a population.

Use the *intro* section of the following simulation to examine the effect of selection pressures on the phenotypic distribution of a population. Focus on the phenotypes, phenotype frequencies, and selection pressures. Do not focus on the issues of dominant/recessive alleles and allele frequency. 

Make sure to *add a mate* and to introduce a mutation. Then experiment with different affordances in the simulation and take notes on the results you observe across manipulations that you try.

## Exploitation of behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns that are stereotyped (ie. FAPs) are, by definition, predictable. As you know from [experiments that test for sign stimuli of FAPs](../observation-and-analysis/components), if a sign stimulus is effectively mimicked, then the FAP will be released as if the natural sign stimulus was encountered. This *sign stimulus : FAP* pair can be thought of as a code. *Code breaking* describes inappropriate release of an FAP by another animal. 

This parasite aggregates mimics an effective sign stimulus to elicit mating behavior from a bee. The parasite can then hitch a ride on the bee back to the hive. 

***Q: What is the FAP in this scenario?***

***Q: What do you think the sign stimulus could be? Name at least two potential alternatives.***

***Q: What testable predictions could you come up with for those alternative hypotheses?***

***Q: What experiment would enable you to distinguish between your alternative hypotheses?***

## Evolutionary Models

:::{admonition} Why?
Ultimately, to *understand* a behavioral phenotype from an evolutionary perspective means to be able to predict when we would observe that phenotype in extant species. This involves both correctly identifying the adaptive role that the behavior plays and the selective pressures that exert evolutionary force on the behavior.
:::

When necessary resources are limited (such as food), then animals are effectively in competition, which enables selective pressures to exert effects on relative fitness among phenotypes. 

### Optimality Theory

Remember [vigilance behavior](../observation-and-analysis/observation)? From an evolutionary perspective, let's think about how to understand vigilance behavior. 

***Q: What do you think a potential adaptive function of vigilance is?***

***Q: What do vigilant animals give up by being vigilant?***

Consider the following model for two alternative phenotypes: *vigilant* and *not vigilant*. 

$$
  F = t + e
$$ (my-math-ref)

where $t$ = time searching for and eating food, $e$ = chance of escaping a predator, and $F$ = net fitness. 


We often see evolutionary explanations in terms of *costs* and *benefits*, but these terms are relative. 

***Q: What is the 'benefit' of being vigilant comparted to being not vigilant?***

***Q: What is the 'cost' of being vigilant comparted to being not vigilant?***

***Q: What is the 'benefit' of being not vigilant comparted to being vigilant?***

***Q: What is the 'cost' of being not vigilant comparted to being vigilant?***

It is more generalizable to talk in terms of *factors* rather than costs or benefits per se.

If there are two phenotypes in a population (in this case vigilant or not vigilant), then the phenotype that confers greater total fitness to the animal will be favored by natural selection. 

Consider the model $ F = t + e $[](my-math-ref) again.

***Q: Which phenotype would have a higher value of $t$?***

***Q: Which phenotype would have a higher value of $e$?***

***Q: Which phenotype would have a higher value of $F$?***

***Q: Given this information, can you determine which phenotype has a higher net fitness? Choose some arbitrary (but logical) values for the benefit and cost factors in your model***

***Q: What kinds of issues are you encountering in using the model to predict which phenotype is more fit?***

Consider how environments can differ. Do all environments have the same amount or quality of food? What about predators? Let's add to the model[](my-math-ref) to reflect how these selective pressures can change.

Consider this revised model for the two alternative phenotypes: *vigilant* and *not vigilant*. 

$$
  F = q*t + p*e
$$ (my-other-math-ref)

where $q$ = the quality or amount of food available, $p$ = the number of predators.

How does this model refine your predictions? Environments exert selective pressure on phenotypes, which means that changing environments can change the relative fitness of two phenotypes. 

***Q: In an environment with a lot of predators and low food quality, which phenotype would you predict to be favored by natural selection?***

***Q: What happens if your model did not correctly predict vigilance behavior of a population that you were studying?***

### Game theory

The main difference between optimality theory and game theory is that game theory takes into account *selective pressure from conspecifics*.

Let's practice with the following common model for two alternative conflict resolution phenotypes: *fighter* and *pacifist*. *Fighter* means to always fight when challenged until the resource is won. *Pacifist* means to share the resource (or get it on average half the time) and to back down when challenged with a fight. 
- Fighters always fight over territory until there is a winner
- Pacifists retreat from aggression and fights, giving up on any resources in question
- Pacifists share resources equally with other pacifists without any fighting

What are the factors that contribute to the fitness of each of these strategies? The resource itself effects an animal's fitness (hypothesis: territory and its quality increases mating and offspring survival). Fighting effects an animal's fitness (hypothesis: fighting incurs costs of losing the fight). In this model, let's make $v$ = the value of a limited resource and $c$ = the damage done by losing a fight over a resource.

After a fighter encounters another fighter, its fitness changes by $ F = v $ if it wins but $ F = -c $ if it loses.
After a pacifist encounters another pacifist, its fitness changes by $ F = v/2 $ because they share the resource.

***Q: Following this logic... after a fighter encounters a pacifist how would its fitness change (in terms of $v$ and $c$)?***

***Q: Following this logic... after a pacifist encounters a fighter how would its fitness change (in terms of $v$ and $c$)?***

***Q: When a fighter and a fighter compete, what are the two potential outcomes for each individual? What is the probability of each outcome?***

***Q: When a pacifist and a pacifist compete, what is the one outcome for each individual? What is the probability of that one outcome?***

***Q: When a pacifist and a pacifist compete, what is the one outcome for each individual? What is the probability of that one outcome?***

For example, loons (a species of bird in US and Canada) are in competition for territory. Specifically, male loons are the ones that establish and maintain territory, and they host a female mate on their territory. Males with territory have the opportunity to mate. Males without territory (or with a worse territory) are in conflict with territory owners over the chance to mate. 
Would we predict that loons are pacifists or fighters? Which behavioral phenotype is favored by natural selection?

To analyze this problem, first consider a population of all *fighters* in which rare *pacifist* mutations pop up. 

***Q: According to the model, calculate the average fitness (in terms of $v$ and $c$) of a mutant pacifist against a fighter.***

***Q: According to the model, calculate the average fitness (in terms of $v$ and $c$) of a fighter against another fighter.***

***Q: In the context of a population of fighers, what additional information do you need to know in order to determine which phenotype would be more fit?***

Game theory models like the pacifist : fighter model you have been considering, are often represented in tabular format.

:::{figure-md}
:class: figure

<img src="/images/game-theory-figher-pacifist.jpg" alt="fishy" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="300px">

A tabular representation of the game theory model for *pacifist* versus *fighter* conflict resolution behavioral phenotypes. Each box of the table is split by a diagonal line. The fitness of each phenotype (green) in each context (purple) is written to the left of the diagonal line in each box of the table. A complexity of the selective pressure of conspecific phenotype is that the selective pressure is also under selective pressure... see the net fitness from the purple perspective.

***Q: If the value of the resource (in this case territory) is very valuable relative to the cost of losing a fight, which phenotype would be more fit in the context of a population of fighers?***
