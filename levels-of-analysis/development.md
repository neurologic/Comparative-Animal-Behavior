# Development

::::{admonition} Why?

:::{epigraph}
In the study of development we are interested not only in the final state to which the system arrives, but also in the course by which it gets there

-- C.H. Waddington, 1957.

:::{epigraph}
Given the evidence, familiar to everyone, that numerous environmental inputs are consistently supplied (essential) during normal development, the skepticism of biologists regarding the reliability of environmental factors relative to that of genes has to rank among the oddest blind spots of biological thought. Contrary to common belief, environmentally initiated novelties may have greater evolutionary potential than mutationally induced ones. 

-- [Mary Jane West-Eberhard (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0501844102)

Animals don’t start their lives as tiny copies of adults; there are all sorts of changes that a creature goes through from fertilization to birth and from newborn to mature. This development is called ontogeny. In this session, we explore how ontogenetic change impacts animal behavior as they grow.

## Case Study: Polyphenism in Tiger Salamanders

Adult tiger salamander larvae exist in one of two behavioral phenotypes: *normal* and *cannibal*.

In this experiment, phenotypically indistinct salamander larvae were housed together in various conditions (as shown). A jar was used to specifically manipulate the environment of a *focal* larva. The behavioral phenotype of the focal larva was asessed after larval development was completed. Each manipulation was repeated 16 times.

## Case Study: Aggression

Variation among individuals in aggressiveness is linked in many species to variation in the serotonergic system and to variation in early exposure to androgens.

This grapsh shows the first evidence of hormone-mediated maternal effects in mammals (spotted hyenas). Our results suggested an organizational mechanism for the development of female aggressiveness in spotted hyaenas. A developmental perspective suggests that prenatal hormone exposure constrains the flexibility of aggressive behaviour in individual spotted hyaenas throughout their lives by influencing, to some extent, their baseline aggressiveness. This relationship between maternal faecal androgen concentration and cub aggression was not directly affected by maternal rank, maternal aggressiveness or any other variable explored.[^Holekamp2013]

Motor programs used in fruit fly aggression. The Venn diagram shows the different motor programs used in male and female aggression. Some of the motor programs are sexually dimorphic. The motor programs encircled in blue are specific for male aggression. The motor programs encircled in red are specific to female aggression. The intersection enlists the motor programs common to both male and female aggression (A). The most consistent motor program in male aggression is a *lunge* (B). In a lunge, a male fly stands on its hind legs and snaps down on its opponent. The most consistent motor program in female aggression is a *head butt*. In a head butt, the female fly extends her torso and strikes the opponent with her head (C).[^Sengupta2022]

For the first two days, larvae are fed *royal jelly* and then switched to pollen and nectar. Some larvae remain on the royal jelly diet and become reproductively viable queens. DNMT3 is a protein that methylates cytosine nucleotides and controls the pattern of *DNA methylation* across the genome. To do its job, DNMT3, like any other protein, must be transcribed and translated (*expressed*).[^Kucharski2008]

## Case Study: Nurses and Foragers

Honey bee workers exhibit strong and stable differences in behavior between individuals. Behavioral differences arise as part of a system of age-related, socially regulated division of labor common to species of social insects. Bees perform several different tasks in the hive during the first 2 to 3 weeks of adult life, including brood care (“nursing”), and then shift to foraging for nectar and pollen outside the hive for the remainder of their 5- to 7-week life. The timing of the transition from hive work to foraging is also variable and may be accelerated, delayed, or reversed depending on the needs of the colony. These changes in role are associated with changes in brain structure and neurochemistry.

<img src="/images/nurse-forager-expression.jpeg" alt="fishy" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="800px" style="background-color:white">

Individual brain gene expression profiles predict behavioral phenotype between young nurses (YN) and old foragers (OF) from typical bee colonies and experimental colonies.  Expression levels (measured as messenger RNA abundance) are indicated by color scale in which expression ratio (F/N) is average for all foragers and nurses (n = 30 per group). In the absence of old bees, some individuals initiate foraging as much as 2 weeks earlier than usual (*young forager* single cohort). If there are more foragers in the population than normal, some nurses will delay the developmental transition. Individual brain gene expression profiles are shown for age-matched young nurses and young (“precocious”) foragers, and age-matched old foragers and old (“overage”) nurses. Further experiments should help to determine which genes are responding to environmental cues known to be important regulators of behavior, and which genes and pathways cause changes in behavior.

Because foragers are older than nurses in a typical population, examination of bees from typical colonies did not reveal whether gene expression differences are associated with behavior or with age.

## Summary
What about 'species typical' behavior that is variable? Why does an animal behave the way it does? Maybe because of conditions it encountered during development, or even adulthood. Environments influence behavioral development. The environment can modulate development, generating sources of phenotypic variation. And events that happen during development can effect an animal's fitness as an adult. Early life conditions can have positive, negative, or no effects on behavioral development and fitness, either current or future, depending on the species and environment in which it lives.

### Epigenetics

***Q: Do all somatic cells (cells of the body tissues) within an individual animal have the same genome? Explain your reasoning.***

***Q: Do all somatic cells have the same protein composition? Explain your reasoning.***

In order to be transcribed and translated, DNA must be accessible to various proteins. DNA accessibility is tightly controlled by molecular tags on the DNA itself and on histone proteins around which it winds. Critically, these tags are flexibly bound to DNA and histone - tags bind or unbind in response to signals from the environment.

"(A) Schematic of epigenetic modifications. Strands of DNA are wrapped around histone octamers, forming nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are organized into chromatin, the building block of a chromosome. Reversible and site-specific histone modifications occur at multiple sites through acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation. DNA methylation occurs at 5-position of cytosine residues in a reaction catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Together, these modifications provide a unique epigenetic signature that regulates chromatin organization and gene expression. (B) Schematic of the reversible changes in chromatin organization that influence gene expression: genes are expressed (switched on) when the chromatin is open (active), and they are inactivated (switched off) when the chromatin is condensed (silent). These dynamic chromatin states are controlled by reversible epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications.

### Spatial Memory Circuits

Neural circuits for specific behaviors are constructed throughout development according to the genome. Hormones modulate gene expression during development.  

***Q: What aspect of the genetic mechanism of behavior would hormones need to effect in order to change behavioral phenotypes?***

In vertebrates, steroid hormones are often involved in the development of sexually dimorphic behavior. Voles exhibit sexual dimorphism in their spatial memory. Greater spatial memory leads to larger homerange sizes (greater dispersal from their home). Males have better spatial memory than females and have larger homerange sizes than females (especially during breeding season). It seems that androgens modulate the development of neural circuits underlying spatial memory. One way to investigate the effects of sex steroids on spatial memory is to examine the effect of in utero position or litter sex-ratio. Males produce androgen hormones during development. Therefore, offspring in a male-biased litter will be exposed to higher levels of androgens *in-utero*.

In a test of spatial learning called a 'water maze', the 'latency to reach platform' decreases as learning occurs across *blocks* of training. Animals with better spatial memory do better on this spatial learning task. Symbols represent the mean across animals and error bars are 'standard of the mean.' [^hormone-spatial-learning-ref]
