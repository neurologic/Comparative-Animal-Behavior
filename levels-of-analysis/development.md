# Development


Developmental environments influence behavior (current and future). 

Why does an animal behave the way it does? Maybe because of conditions it encountered during development. 

## Imprinting and Learning


## *EPI*genetics.

In order to be transcribed and translated, DNA must be accessible to various proteins. DNA accessibility is tightly controlled by molecular tags on the DNA itself and on histone proteins around which it winds. Critically, these tags are flexibly bound to DNA and histone - tags bind or unbind in response to signals from the environment.

Epigenetic mechanisms involved in regulation of gene expression. Cytosine residues within DNA can be methylated, and lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins can be modified. Me = methylation, Ac = acetylation, P = phosphorylation, Ub = ubiquitination. Image from [Promega](https://www.promega.com/resources/guides/nucleic-acid-analysis/introduction-to-epigenetics/).

"(A) Schematic of epigenetic modifications. Strands of DNA are wrapped around histone octamers, forming nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are organized into chromatin, the building block of a chromosome. Reversible and site-specific histone modifications occur at multiple sites through acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation. DNA methylation occurs at 5-position of cytosine residues in a reaction catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Together, these modifications provide a unique epigenetic signature that regulates chromatin organization and gene expression. (B) Schematic of the reversible changes in chromatin organization that influence gene expression: genes are expressed (switched on) when the chromatin is open (active), and they are inactivated (switched off) when the chromatin is condensed (silent). These dynamic chromatin states are controlled by reversible epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications.

## In utero environment

### Spatial Learning

Neural circuits for specific behaviors are constructed throughout development according to the genome. Hormones modulate gene expression during development. This enables behavioral flexibility at the level of the species. 

***Q: What aspect of the genetic mechanism of behavior would hormones need to effect in order to change behavioral phenotypes?***

In vertebrates, steroid hormones are often involved in the development of sexually dimorphic behaivor. Voles exhibit sexual dimorphism in their spatial memory. Males have larger homerange sizes than females - they disperse further from their home (especially during breeding season). Males also have better spatial memory than females. It seems that androgens modulate the development of neural circuits underlying spatial memory.  One way to investigate the effects of sex steroids on spatial memory is to examine the effect of in utero position or litter sex-ratio. Males produce androgen hormones during development. Therefore, offspring in a male-biased litter will be exposed to higher levels of androgens *in-utero*.

In a test of spatial learning called a 'water maze', the 'latency to reach platform' decreases as learning occurs across *blocks* of training. Animals with better spatial memory do better on this spatial learning task. Symbols represent the mean across animals and error bars are 'standard of the mean.' [^hormone-spatial-learning-ref]

### Aggression

Variation among individuals in aggressiveness is linked in many species to variation in the serotonergic system and to variation in early exposure to androgens [70,71]. In earlier work [72], we found that both male and female spotted hyaena cubs born to mothers excreting high concentrations of faecal androgens during pregnancy exhibit higher rates of aggression than do cubs born to mothers with lower androgen concentrations (figure 1a). This relationship between maternal faecal androgen concentration and cub aggression was not directly affected by maternal rank, maternal aggressiveness or any other variable explored. Such hormone-mediated maternal effects had never previously been reported in mammals. Our results suggested an organizational mechanism for the development of female aggressiveness in spotted hyaenas, traits presumably mediated by effects of early hormone exposure on structure and function of the developing nervous system. Organizational effects of androgens are known to include modification of morphological features of the developing brain via influencing processes of synaptogenesis and cell death [74â€“76]. A developmental perspective suggests that prenatal hormone exposure constrains the flexibility of aggressive behaviour in individual spotted hyaenas throughout their lives by influencing, to some extent, their baseline aggressiveness


## Polyphenisms

The environment can modulate development, generating sources of phenotypic variation. And events that happen during development can effect an animal's fitness as an adult. Early life conditions can have positive, negative, or no effects on behavioral development and fitness, either current or future, depending on the species and environment in which it lives.
