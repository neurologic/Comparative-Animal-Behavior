:::{admonition} Why?
Animals have a blueprint of behavioral actions that are each controlled by specific genetically-coded neural circuits. However, animals don't (can't) do all of their actions at once... at any moment in time, the intensity of each behavior must be modulated to match the demands of the animal's external environment (resource quality, social cues, etc) as well as internal environment (metabolic demands, internal *state*, etc). 
:::

Without genes and neurons, hormones would do nothing. In other words, they *modulate* existing genetic and neural systems. Modulation can happen reversibly over relatively short timescales or irreversibly (usually "during development").

## General Mechanism

- Steroid hormones are lipid soluble while non-steroid hormones (amino acid based - proteins, peptides, and derivatives) are water soluble. 
- Hormones generally do nothing by themselves. Hormone *receptors* change genetic and physiological properties of cells when they are in contact with their specific hormone molecule. 
- Hormones circulate in the blood and extracellular fluid of the body.

***Q: Hormone receptors can either be in the cell membrane or within the cell. Would receptors specific for non-steroid hormones be located on the cell membrane or within the cell? Why?***

Cartoon of a common hormone mechanism of action. The hormone is binding to specific receptors on the cell's surface. Receptor binding triggers a conformational change that causes *G-proteins* to bind to adenylate cyclase proteins. When G-protein binds adenylate cyclase, cAMP is produced, which then triggers protein kinases to act on their specific downstream targets. R = hormone receptor, G = G-protein, ATP = adenosine triphosphate, cAMP = cyclic adenonsine monophosphate

In this case, the hormone and its receptor form a transcription factor that alters gene expression directly.

***Q: Why are molecules such as cAMP necessary for water-soluble hormones to effect gene expression?***

***Q: cAMP is referred to as a 'second messenger,' which makes the hormone the 'first messenger.' Explain this terminology in terms of the difference between lipid-soluble hormones (ie steroids) and non-lipid-soluble hormones (ie peptides).***

***Q: What is the effect of a hormone if there are no receptors for the hormone?***

Finally, hormones can either be produced within an animal's body or tranferred (often via ingestion) from their environment.

## Case Study: Sexual Behavior

Behavior in virgin animals often differs dramatically from behavior in mated animals. In fruit flies, male gonads manufacture a peptide termed '*sex peptide*' that gets transferred to females during insemination. Sex peptide provides a long-lasting signal that effects multiple mating behavior neural circuits in a female fly. For example, virgin females do not lay eggs and do not crave salt (NaCl) or yeast. However, after mating, females lay lots of eggs and crave/eat lots of salt and yeast (salt and yeast are necessary nutrients for egg production).

Sex Peptide stimulates both egg production and anticipatory appetites necessary to support reproduction through the SPSN-SAG neuronal circuit. Left: virgin female. Right: sex peptide is transferred to the female during mating. The fly central nervous system (yellow) is shown from above within the boxed region. SAG and SPSN neurons are highlighed. SAG = sex peptide abdominal ganglion neuron (green); SPSN = sex peptide sensory neuron (purple). SPSN axon terminals synapse on SAG dendrites in the abdominal ganglion. SAG neurons send axons to the head ganglion. Sex peptide is sensed by neuron dendrites the uterus of the female. SPSNs are normally *active*, meaning they continuously produce voltage spike events (green). SPSNs excite SAGs. SAGs inhibit egg laying and salt/yeast appetites.[^sex-peptide-dispatch][^sex-peptide-prediction]

***Q: In this neural circuit, which type of neuron (SAG or SPSN) has receptors for sex peptide?***

***Q: Does sex peptide inhibit or excite the SPSN?***

***Q: Why does the SAG neuron produce voltage spike events in virgin females, but not mated females?***

Sex peptide has LOTS of modulatory effects on the nervous system (in both females and males). Interestingly, sex peptide was recently shown to enhance long term memory of female fruit flies.

Drosophila virgin females cannot form long-term memory. Upon fecundation, the sex peptide is transferred from the male testis to the female ovary. From there, the sex peptide reaches the brain and activates a pair of neurons that controls long-term memory formation. SPN = sex peptide receptive neurons in the brain; VNC = ventral nerve cord; MIP = myoinhibitory peptide (released from SPNs); Dnc PDE = Dunce phosphodiesterase that degrades cAMP; PKA = protein kinase A. PKA activity puts SPNs in an 'activatable' state for long-term memory formation. As a default state, Dnc PDE inhibits the cAMP-PKA pathway within SPNs, which inhibits long-term memory formation. PKA activation leads to the release of MIP, which increases the effects of sex peptide, further increasing long-term memory formation. [^sex-peptide-memory-ref]
