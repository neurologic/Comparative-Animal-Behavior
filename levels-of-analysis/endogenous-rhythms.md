Activity throughout each day is plotted as the height of individual bars across time. Lighting conditions throughout each day are shown above the plots. Each row is a different day (with the day before re-plotted on the same row). A) Entrained (synchronized) B) Free-Run C) Arhythmic.

***Q1: Compare A to B. What is the experimental manipulation? Why do the results of this experiment provide evidence that animals must have an internal time-keeping mechanism ("clock")? What other variables might need to be controlled in this experiment to increase the evidence for this conclusion?***

***Q2: Why is it better to think of an animal's activity budget as dependent on time of day than to think of the activity budget as constant throughout the day? For stridulation and locomotion, what would be the calculated activity budget in each case?***

Internal clocks alone are generally not sufficient to synchronize behavior among a population.

A) Under constant light conditions, the period of circadian stridulation is variable across the group. B) Under constant light conditions, the phase of peak activity (stridulation, top; locomotion, bottom) is variable within an individual.

## The "CLOCK"

What keeps track of time?

Left: The cricket nervous system is shown in yellow overlaid on a dorsal view of the body. The brain ganglia are located in the head. Neurons in the retina (where light receptors are located for the visual system) project to the optic lobe, which then projects to the central ganglia. Right: Actograms of normal stridulation behavior for crickets with an intact nervous system, a nervous system where the retinal projections were severed (A, red), and a nervous system where the optic lobe projections were severed (B, blue).

[^scn-excitability]: In most CNS neurons, synaptic activity providing inhibitory or excitatory input to brings the membrane potential closer to, or further from, threshold to initiate firing. However, in SCN neurons which fire spontaneously via intrinsic mechanisms, neuromodulation contributes to the pattern, synchronization, and plasticity of firing. Glutamate is the major neuromodulator for photic entrainment, while GABA, substance P, histamine, serotonin, neuropeptide Y, melatonin, and orexin contribute to non-photic input that entrains SCN activity to other environmental factors and/or internal states. Some neuromodulation of SCN excitability is direct, via ionotropic receptors that mediate synaptic activity. Studies are not yet in good agreement on whether there is a circadian rhythm in synaptic activity, either via excitatory (glutamatergic) or inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic channels (186, 202). Additional neuromodulation of SCN excitability occurs indirectly via metabotropic receptors that activate intracellular signaling pathways. Thus a panoply of neuromodulators ultimately enact their effects on SCN neuronal activity through the ion channels that directly regulate membrane excitability.
