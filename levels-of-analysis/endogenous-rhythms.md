***Q1: Compare A to B. What is the experimental manipulation? Why do the results of this experiment provide evidence that animals must have an internal time-keeping mechanism ("clock")? What other variables might need to be controlled in this experiment to increase the evidence for this conclusion?***

***Q2: Why is it better to think of an animal's activity budget as dependent on time of day than to think of the activity budget as constant throughout the day? For stridulation and locomotion, what would be the calculated activity budget in each case?***

Internal clocks alone are generally not sufficient to synchronize behavior among a population. Variability both within and across individuals de-synchrnizes the cyclic pattern of behavior across individuals.

The circadian clock is rooted in a molecular/genetic mechanism. A gene expression negative feedback loop combined with protein degredation enables a central *pacemaker* to keep a temporal rhythm.

From [Generation of circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-018-0026-z): TTFLs orchestrate changes in Na+ and K+ conductances and [Ca2+]i that drive the SCN neuron between daytime electrical activity and nocturnal quiescence. The circadian profile of [Ca2+]i is directed by several mechanisms: voltage-gated channels activated by electrical firing, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and neuropeptide signalling via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) activated by the retinohypothalamic tract. Changes in [Ca2+]i provide access to the TTFL via Ca2+/cAMP response elements (CREs) on the period (PER) genes, and, as a consequence, various circadian outputs become inputs to the TTFL, enhancing its stability and precision.

In vertebrates specifically, the "master" circadian clock is located in the ***suprachiasmatic nucleus*** (**SCN**) of the *hypothalamus*. The spiking activity of SCN neurons is directly modulated by the transcription-translation feeback loop (TTFL) ticking away in its nucleus. In SCN neurons, electrical activity and the molecular oscillation of the TTFL are tightly interlinked.

[^scn-excitability]: In most CNS neurons, synaptic activity providing inhibitory or excitatory input to brings the membrane potential closer to, or further from, threshold to initiate firing. However, in SCN neurons which fire spontaneously via intrinsic mechanisms, neuromodulation contributes to the pattern, synchronization, and plasticity of firing. Glutamate is the major neuromodulator for photic entrainment, while GABA, substance P, histamine, serotonin, neuropeptide Y, melatonin, and orexin contribute to non-photic input that entrains SCN activity to other environmental factors and/or internal states. Some neuromodulation of SCN excitability is direct, via ionotropic receptors that mediate synaptic activity. Studies are not yet in good agreement on whether there is a circadian rhythm in synaptic activity, either via excitatory (glutamatergic) or inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic channels (186, 202). Additional neuromodulation of SCN excitability occurs indirectly via metabotropic receptors that activate intracellular signaling pathways. Thus a panoply of neuromodulators ultimately enact their effects on SCN neuronal activity through the ion channels that directly regulate membrane excitability.

## Circadian Rhythms, Case Study: Melatonin and Mating Behavior


Male midshipman fish generate a vocalization called a "hum" to attract females. The hum by rapdily contracting their drumming muscle on their swim bladder. Each hum can last for a long duration (hours). Mating behavior in these fish is nocturnal.

The research group of Andy Bass at Cornell University investigated the mechanism of circadian humming behavior in midshipman fish[^feng-bass-2016]. To do so, they manipulated both light and hormone levels. 

This research group first investigated the circadian rhythm of humming.

The first experimental paradigm used alternating bouts of LD and DD circadian cycles. In the actogram, white background denotes light and gray denotes darkness. The humming activity is marked in black throughout each day.

***Q5: Do midshipman fish have a circadian clock for singing behavior? What is your evidence for this?***

***Q6: What activity pattern would you predict in constant light conditions?***

***Melatonin*** (a hormone) is primarily produced by the pineal gland at night (under the control of SCN spiking activity)[^melatonin-feedback]. Therefore, this clock-hormone pathway translates the external light-dark cycle into an internal hormonal message. Light inhibits melatonin production (in part by increasing the spiking activity of SCN neurons). Constant light is therefore an effective, non-invasive method for decreasing melatonin synthesis. The same research group of Andy Bass utilized this manipulation to investigate how melatonin modulated singing behavior[^feng-bass-2016].  

[^melatonin-feedback]: Interestingly, melatonin also effects SCN activity. SCN neurons have melatonin receptors and melatonin binding reduces the neurons' spiking activity.

A) The second experimental paradigm used a transition from LD conditions to LL conditions. At the LD to LL transition, groups of fish were either treated with exogenous melatonin (*2-iMel*; experimental gorup), or treated with placebo (control group). The exogenous melatonin in the experimental group was administered using an "implant" (meaning melatonin is slowly and constantly released into the blood). B) Effects on total daily hum duration. C) Effects on hum activity.

***Q7: Does the hormone melatonin have an excitatory or inhibitory effect on humming behavior? What is your evidence for this?***

***Q8: Under DD conditions, the fish exhibited free-run hum activity (Figure 51). However, under LL conditions, the fish now exhibited what kind of activity pattern?***

***Q9: Can you think of any reasons why an endogenous circadian pattern of humming was not recovered in the experimental group (Figure 52C)?***

Interestingly, melatonin seems to be acting at two different parts of the singing circuits in the brain of midshipman fish: 
1. permitting humming behavior (bringing *command* neurons for the behavior closer to spike threshold) 
2. lengthening the period of *central pattern generator* circuits for individual hums. 

Consistent with these different scales of effect (motivation for the behavior and the pattern of the behavioral action itself), melatonin receptors are found in BOTH ***neuroendocrine*** regions of the brain and ***vocal-acoustic*** regions. For example: there were melatonin receptors in the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (POA-AH), which is known to control vertebrate social and reproductive behaviors; and there are melatonin receptors in the hindbrain central pattern generator that directly controls the coordination and timing of vocal muscule contractions.

Additionally, in species that are active during the day (like songbirds), melatonin **inhibits** overall levels of vocalization behavior yet lengthens the duration of individual songs.

Based on this experimental data, which species (squirrels or stonechats) would you infer lived in an environment with more predictably timed changes in the weather?

### Circadian sensitivity to light

A common mechanism for timing yearly cycles of behavior relies on ***photoperiodism***: the ability to detect the *photoperiod* (day length). This is accomplished by a mechanism with a circadian cycle of sensitivity to light. This mechanism would be insensitive to light from dawn until wintertime dusk. Sensitivity would increase between the winter and summer dusk times. 

Photoperiodism (circadian cycles of sensitivity to light) can provide a mechanism for timing circannual behaviors such as reproduction.

### Unpredictable cues

In some cases, unpredictable cues (such as rain fall) may be more informative than predictable ones (such as annual changes in day length) for reproductive timing

:::{image} /images/unpredictable-cues.png
:width: 600

However, the ability to respond to these external cues often depends on a circannual rhythm of overall "readiness".
