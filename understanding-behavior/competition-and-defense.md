When necessary resources are limited (such as food), then animals are in competition. There are many ways to behave in the face of such competition. 

For example, loons (a species of bird in US and Canada) are in competition for territory. Specifically, male loons are the ones that establish and maintain territory, and they host a female mate on their territory. Males with territory have the opportunity to mate. Males without territory (or with a worse territory) need to challenge territory owners in order to get the chance to mate. 

***Q: What are some of the ways that a territory owner could behave when challenged for their territory?***

***Q: What are the factors associated with each of those behavioral choices that effects the animal's fitness?***

How do we understand species-typical behavior in a particular competitive scenario? One part of understanding is to develop a model based on evolutionary factors. 

Let's consider two alternate behavioral strategies to start: *fighter* and *pacifist*. *Fight* means to always fight when challenged until the resource is won. *Pacifist* means to share the resource (or get it on average half the time) and to back down when challenged with a fight. 

What are the factors that contribute to the fitness of each of these strategies? The resource itself effects an animal's fitness (hypothesis: territory and its quality increases mating and offspring survival). Fighting effects an animal's fitness (hypothesis: fighting incurs costs of losing the fight). 

Assign a variable for each of these factors. 

***Q: When a fighter and a fighter compete, what are the two potential outcomes for each individual? What is the probability of each outcome?***

***Q: When a pacifist and a pacifist compete, what is the one outcome for each individual? What is the probability of that one outcome?***

***Q: When a pacifist and a pacifist compete, what is the one outcome for each individual? What is the probability of that one outcome?***

***Q: In terms of the variables you chose for each factor (resource and losing a fight), how would you calculate the average change in fitness of a pacifist when it is challenged by another pacifist?***

***Q: ***
