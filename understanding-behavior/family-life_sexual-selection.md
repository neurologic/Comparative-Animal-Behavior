# Sexual Selection

:::{admonition} Why?
Evolution by natural selection is often summarized as evolution by “survival of the fittest.” How is it, then, that in certain species of spiders (also in certain insects) the male is eaten by the female in the act of copulation?

The range of factors that can exert selective pressure on behavior is vast. Some behaviors are shaped more by individual survival and physiological fitness, others are shaped more by reproductive fitness. Behaviors shaped by reproductive fitness directly (for example, behaviors that function in mate attraction) tend to result in elaborate traits that actually detract from physiological fitness (like health or predation risk).

## Sexual Dimporphism

In many species, sexually-selected behaviors or behavioral elaborations have evolved only in one sex and not both: **di**: two; **morph**: form. When different phenotypes are distinguished by sex, it is called ***dimorphism***.

Several key reproductive concepts are key to understanding why...

:::{glossary}

sex ratio
  ratio of males to females

operational sex ratio 
  ratio of sexually receptive males to sexually receptive females

reproductive variance
  the variance in mating success across individuals of one sex

***Q1: What is the sex ratio of this spider population?***

***Q2: What is the operational sex ratio of this spider population?***

***Q3: Assuming that each individual can only mate once each season, which sex will have a more difficult time finding a mate?***

It would be ideal to be able to choose a mate that would provide you with the most optimal fitness (number, viability, and mating success of offspring). Inequality in the ability to be ***choosy*** about a mate is one of the main factors leading to ***sexually dimorphic behavior***. Ultimately, it is better to mate with someone than no one. If you are a member of the sex that exists in abundance (operational sex ratio), then the most pressing issue you face is just to secure a mate at all. If you are a member of the sex that exists in scarcity, then you are basically guaranteed someone to mate with, and the more pressing issue you face is making sure you get the best mate possible. 

In animals with an operational sex ratio close to one and equal reproductive variance between the sexes, we predict that both sexes face similar issues of mate procurement and choise. In these animals, the need to attract mates exerts equal selective pressure (sexual selection) on the behavior of both sexes and there is little sexual dimorphism.

Black swans exhibit mutual ornamentation. Both males and females look the same, with curled wing feathers that serve a sexual function. These feathers are used in mutual mate choice, where both males and females have a preference for mates with wing feathers that are more curled.

Many factors weigh in on mate choice to shape behavior over evolutionary timescales. The three main categories are: direct benefits, indirect benefits, and exploitation.

## Direct Benefits

Mates are selected based on ***what they can offer directly to the chooser*** that will increase its physiological fitness.

## Indirect Benefits

Mates are selected based on ***what they can offer indirectly to the chooser's offspring***.

### Good Genes

### Attractiveness 

(aka ***Runaway Selection***)

The offspring will be more reproductively successful themselves simply because they are more attractive to females.

## Exploitation

(aka ***Chase-away Selection***)

## Cryptic choice

Bias in fertilization that occurs after mating or in the release of gamets... either manipulating fertilization of gametes directly, or or through development via manipulation of fetal growth or survival.

The ability of Drosophila females to eject sperm after mating. Also seen in many bird species such as dunnocks. This biases fertilization of their eggs for certain mating partners.

In some bird species, the female adjusts the amount of testosterone that she contributes to a fertilized egg in relation to the attractiveness of her mate.
