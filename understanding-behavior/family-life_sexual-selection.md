# Sexual Selection

:::{admonition} Why?
Evolution by natural selection is often summarized as evolution by “survival of the fittest.” How is it, then, that in certain species of spiders (also in certain insects) the male is eaten by the female in the act of copulation?

sex ratio
  ratio of males to females

operational sex ratio 
  ratio of sexually receptive males to sexually receptive females

***Q1: What is the sex ratio of this spider population?***

***Q2: What is the operational sex ratio of this spider population?***

***Q3: Assuming that each individual can only mate once each season, which sex will have a more difficult time finding a mate?***

***Mate choice*** is one of the main factors leading to ***sexually dimorphic behavior*** (elaborations of the behavior in only one sex). In animals with an operational sex ratio close to one and equal reproductive variance between the sexes, we predict that both sexes can choose their mate (be choosy). In these animals, the need to attract mates exerts equal selective pressure (sexual selection) on the behavior of both sexes equally and there is little sexual dimorphism.

Black swans exhibit mutual ornamentation. Both males and females look the same, with curled wing feathers that serve a sexual function. These feathers are used in mutual mate choice, where both males and females have a preference for mates with wing feathers that are more curled.

Several factors weigh in on mate choice that shape behavior over evolutionary timescales: direct benefits, indirect benefits, and exploitation.

## Direct Benefits

## Indirect Benefits

### Good Genes

### Attractiveness 

(aka ***Runaway Selection***)

## Cryptic choice

Bias in fertilization that occurs after mating or in the release of gamets... either manipulating fertilization of gametes directly, or or through development via manipulation of fetal growth or survival.

The ability of Drosophila females to eject sperm after mating. Also seen in many bird species such as dunnocks. This biases fertilization of their eggs for certain mating partners.

In some bird species, the female adjusts the amount of testosterone that she contributes to a fertilized egg in relation to the attractiveness of her mate.

## Exploitation

(aka ***Chase-away Selection***)
