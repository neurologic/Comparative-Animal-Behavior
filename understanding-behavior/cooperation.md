# Grouping and Cooperation


## The effect of group size on vigilance

Record the following:

Flock size
The number of times they are in the ‘head up’ position
The start and stop time of each ‘head up’ position.
I recommend using a stopwatch for this. Here is a link to the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeJHW5n-PXY):

Calculate the total number of ‘head up’ behaviors and the total duration of ‘head up’ for each flock size and enter into the following data sheet. Then share with your partner.

## Dilution versus confusion

mayflies... number versus death rate
targetting prey and ability to track 

## Mobbing

kittyhawk gulls versus cliff nesting - phylogeny

## Grouping versus Cooperation

Is there a difference?
