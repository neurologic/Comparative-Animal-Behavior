# Communication: Ultimate

Last class, we touched on various aspects of a definition of communication that was roughly: *A sender communicates a signal to a receiver, the signal contains information, and the receiver acts upon the signal.*

What determines the modality of communication?

Which of the following would you say are examples of communication, and which are not?
- a male frog calls to advertise itself to females
- a predatory bat learns where a male frog is located by listening for its calls to females
- a human calls to a dog to get it to come to it 
- a fiddler crab

## Function 

A hypothesis about the function of a behavior is a hypothesis about ***what selective pressures*** shaped it.

***Q: How are distance and direction independently communicated?***

***Q: What mechanism do you think the bee is using for determining distance and direction of their subsequent foraging path? How would you test?***

### Mating

#### Sender and receiver matching

crickets: A central question pervading 50 years of research is how the essential match between signal features and receiver characteristics has evolved and is maintained during evolution.

### Defense

### Competition

Male fiddler crabs (*Uca annulipes*) dig burrows to house their female mates after oviposition. They often fight each other over burrow ownership. If they lose their large claw in a fight, male fiddler crabs grow a new one which has less mass and is a less effective weapon, but costs less to use in signalling than an equivalent-length claw of the original form. 

Males use claw length in assessing an opponent’s fighting ability (Jennions & Backwell 1996). Presumably, males visually assess the fighting ability of potential opponents using claw length
as a signal of strength. Regenerated claws effectively bluff fighting ability and deter potential opponents before they fight. 

### Parent-Offspring Care


## Eavesdropping

***Q: How does this factor in to evolutionary models on the sender side?***

## Honesty and Deceit

Animal communication theory predicts that low-frequency cheating should be common in generally
honest signalling systems.
