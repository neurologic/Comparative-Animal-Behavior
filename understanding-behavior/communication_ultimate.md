# Communication: Ultimate

What determines the modality of communication?

Which of the following would you say are examples of communication, and which are not?
- a male frog calls to advertise itself to females
- a predatory bat learns where a male frog is located by listening for its calls to females
- a human calls to a dog to get it to come to it 
- a fiddler crab

## Function 

A hypothesis about the function of a behavior is a hypothesis about ***what selective pressures*** shaped it.

***Q: How are distance and direction independently communicated?***

***Q: What mechanism do you think the bee is using for determining distance and direction of their subsequent foraging path? How would you test?***

### Mating

#### Sender and receiver matching

crickets: A central question pervading 50 years of research is how the essential match between signal features and receiver characteristics has evolved and is maintained during evolution.

### Defense


## Eavesdropping

***Q: How does this factor in to evolutionary models on the sender side?***
