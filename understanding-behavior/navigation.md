The innate capacity to chemoattract towards food cues was presumably shaped over evolutionary time scales to maximize fitness. This raises the possibility that animals will adhere to neuroeconomic-driven theories that postulate rationality in decision-making processes. Iwanir et al (2019)[^Iwanir] found that C. elegans worms violate key rational decision-making paradigms. Behavioral analysis of mutant strains demonstrates that the violations of rational optimal foraging are mediated by specific sensory neurons.

Why migrate in groups?
- Dilution hypothesis (reduced risk of predation by being in group)?
- avoid getting separated?
- selfish herd (reduce risk of predation by putting other individuals between you and predator)?
- leader is better at finding the way?
- reduced energy? (but only for the followers?)

Wing-beat frequency and heart rate of pelicans engaged
in various types of flight (mean51 s.d.). Birds flying over a river
following a motor boat cruising at a constant speed of 48 km h11
flew at an average altitude of 1 m above the water, initially alone
at a distance from the boat (‘alone at 1 m’), but then joining other
birds in formation (‘in formation’). Numbering of circles indicates
the position in the formation, ‘1’ being the leader. In formation
flights, only birds in or behind the third position were used to
measure heart rate, to avoid the possible effects of motor-boat
turbulence on flight pattern. Wing-beat frequency of the lead and
second birds was measured in groups flying far from the boat.
Birds flying with an ultralight aeroplane cruising at 55–60 km h11
at an altitude of about 50 m were not able or willing to fly in the
wake of the aircraft, and generally flew at a distance, using a
flapping flight, at a speed of 45–50 km h11 (‘alone at 50 m’).
Pelicans following the plane finished their flight of 3 km with a
glide of 2–3 min (‘gliding’) before landing on the water. Heart
rates averaged 77.6515.2 beats per min (b.p.m.) when resting,
and reached 198.2518.7 and 204.9515.7 b.p.m. when
paddling in water and when walking, respectively.[^Weimerskirch-2001]

### Case Study: Blackcap

The European blackcap exhibits enormous variation in migration and is renowned for research on its evolution and genetic basis.

Manipulating the magnetic field to understand the compass mechanism.
:::

Birds have a light-dependent magnetic compass that is suggested to be mediated by light-induced, biochemical reactions in specialized magnetoreceptor molecules in the avian retina. Overhead polarized light modulates radical pair-based magnetic compass orientation.[^Muheim-2015]

For these reasons, (C. elegans) is ideal for studying information-processing mechanisms embedded in the neural network. This paper proposes a neural network model of C. elegans with the actual neural structure preserved to simulate the organism's attraction to sodium chloride (NaCl). To implement attractant behavior, the organism's neural network must calculate the temporal and spatial gradients of NaCl concentration; however, the mechanism behind this complex information processing in the worm's neural network has not yet been fully elucidated. As a first step to analyze the information processing mechanism, the parameters of the neural network model were adjusted using the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, and the neural network model was verified for its ability to generate temporal and spatial gradients. Simulation for neuron ablation experiment was then carried out, and the results exhibited same trends as the biological experiment indicating that our approach can be used to predict the results of biological experiments, and can therefore be used as a tool to provide guidelines for such experiments.)
