# Navigation

Animals navigate in many different contexts. At the very least, navigation is a ***directed*** behavior in some way. It often requires that animals know where they are, know where they are going, and can compute the difference between the two.


## Knowing where you are and where you are going

***Q1: What cues can you think of that animals could use to tell which direction they need to move?***

***Q2: If you were given a compass-based "heading" starting in this classroom, how would you maintain that heading without the compass while you travelled 1 mile away from the classroom?***


## Direction

### Earth's Magnetic Field

The arrows near the Earth’s
surface indicate the intensity (lengths of arrows), direction (direction of arrowhead), and angle of inclination (steepness of the arrows in
relation to the surface of the Earth) of the magnetic field at a particular site.

#### Case Study: Migratory Birds

Many bird species migrate long distances. Even in the absence of visual cues, birds orient toward a specific direction when they take off to migrate. What tools do they use to navigate?

:::{figure} /images/Emlen-funnel.png
:width: 600

Inside this funnel-shaped, circular cage, which can either be lined with a recording
paper (such as typewriter correction paper or thermal paper) or blank newspaper and an inkpad at the bottom, songbirds will hop. Either
method results in marks (scratch marks or ink blotches, respectively) on the paper, which indicate the direction the bird was hopping.
During migration, songbirds will tend to hop in the direction in which they would be flying when placed in Emlen funnels during dusk or
evening. To test for solely magnetic orientation, visual cues can be blocked by covering the funnel with opaque, white Plexiglas.

Research has shown that the earth's magnetic field provides a common directional cue used by birds.

Manipulating the magnetic field to understand the compass mechanism.
:::

:::{figure} /images/avian-compass.png
:width: 300

The birds’ inclination compass is not sensitive to
the direction of the magnetic field, but rather its alignment and sign of inclination. Birds do not distinguish between ‘north’ and ‘south,’
but between ‘equatorwards’ and ‘polewards.’ The side of the magnetic axis where the magnetic field lines meet with the horizon
always leads toward the pole, in both the northern and the southern hemispheres, and the side where the field lines and the horizon
diverge always leads toward the magnetic equator.
:::

Birds have a light-dependent magnetic compass that is suggested to be mediated by light-induced, biochemical reactions in specialized magnetoreceptor molecules in the avian retina. Overhead polarized light modulates radical pair-based magnetic compass orientation.[^Muheim-2015]

Birds would be able to
‘see’ the magnetic field lines as a three-dimensional pattern
of light irradiance (i.e., brightness) or color variation
in their visual field or through a dedicated parallel pathway
in the brain.

Ants can also use magnetic field cues, but the biological mechanism of sensory transduction is not known.

This experiment demonstrates that ants can use a magnetic field to determine their orientation in space. **A**) experimental setup in which the magnetic field around an ant can be controlled. **B**) Two different experimental conditions with the orientation of the magnatic field rotated 90 degrees. **C**) When ants leave the nest for a foraging trip, they perform "look backs" toward the nest site. Comparing the orange to the blue condition shows that the ants use magnetic field cues to determine the direction of the nest relative to where they are heading.

### Light polarization

Many insects use the polarization pattern of sunlight as a direction cue

:::{figure} /images/arthropod-eye-polarization-sense.png

Rhodopsin molecules are sensitive to the polarity of light and are aligned with each other in insect eyes. 
:::


***Q: What do you notice about the location of the sun on the horizon throughout the year? How would this impact the ability of animals to use sunlight polarization cues for global heading?***

### The Neural Compass

:::{figure} /images/central-complex-phylogeny.png
:width: 700

The central complex is a brain structure that, across all insects, provides the animal with the ability to keep track of where it is heading. 
:::

:::{figure} /images/protocerebral-bridge-cues.png
:width: 700

The protocerebral bridge is comprised of neurons that are each *tuned to* a specific direction. The direction is determined by whichever sensory cues that animal uses.

## Distance (Case Study: Ants)

The navigation strategies of *Cataglyphis* ants have been extensively studied for decades. These ants are *thermophiles* that thrive in harsh desert environments. Remarkably, they can navigate long distances with few visual landmarks.

::::

:::{figure} /images/ant-navigation-route.png
:width: 400

*Cataglyphis* ants can return home directly after foraging along a path of over 200 m. 
:::

A simple ***displacement*** experiment shows that ants can tell how far they need to (and have) travelled.

::::{margin} Displacement Experimental Setup
:::{image} /images/displacement-experiment-setup.png
:::
::::

:::{figure} /images/foraging-and-displaced-return.png
:width: 300

After embarking on a foraging run from the home nest (a) to a food site, an ant is displaced to a new location and released (b). Black dots represent the location of the ant at regular time intervals. The graph in (b) shows that the ant does not keep walking once it hits the expected location of the nest (relative to the foraging site) but instead starts searching behavior. 
:::

So how do they know how far they have gone? Wittlinger, Wehner, and Wolf[^Wittlinger-Wehner] hypothesized that ants were using "pacing" (counting steps) to estimate distance. To test this hypothesis, they manipulated the lengths of ants legs when they displaced ants from the foraging site to the release site. 

:::{figure} /images/ant-pedometer-expt.png
:width: 500

**A**) Ant legs were either extended or shortened compared to the normal length control. **B**) The time spent at each location along the return run (*search density*) was quantified as a readout of where the ants expected the nest to be.
:::

:width: 300

**A**) One the return run, a striped grating was either moved faster than the ant, or moved in the opposite direction of the ant's travel. **B**) The distance travelled before searching for the home nest, as a function of the speed of the manipulated visual display.

## Case Study: *c. elegans* searching behavior

Research in the nematode worm *c. elegans* has provided some of the most well-understood proximate explanations for chemotaxis behavior (orienting and moving toward odor sources). 

:::{figure} /images/chemotax-circuit-celegans.jpg
:width: 400

Neural basis of chemotaxic behavior in worms.[^Larsch-2015] A relatively simple neural circuit explains the behavior in which worms navigate toward the location of food. Instead of explicitly "following" an odor concentration gradient, "turning" FAPs are suppressed when odor concentration is increasing. 
:::

The innate capacity to chemoattract towards food cues was presumably shaped over evolutionary time scales to maximize fitness. This raises the possibility that animals will adhere to basic principles of rational (ie adaptive) decision making. Iwanir et al (2019)[^Iwanir] found that C. elegans worms violate key rational decision-making paradigms. For example, if they preferred odor A over odor B, and odor B over odor C, they would *not* necessarily prefer odor A over odor C. Behavioral analysis of mutant strains demonstrates that the violations of rational optimal foraging are mediated by specific sensory neurons.

## Case Study: European Blackcap migration behavior

The European blackcap exhibits enormous variation in migration and is renowned for research on its evolution and genetic basis.

Migration is a multi-trait phenotype (ie. *syndromes*) and different blackcap populations differ in their propensity to migrate as well as the orientation and the distance of migration. Some blackcaps travel rather short distances, others much further, and some populations do not migrate at all. Populations that share the same breeding grounds in the summer may migrate in different directions in the autumn. These features make it a good species to study the genetic variation between populations that migrate in different directions and over different distances.[^blackcap-migration-ed]

[^blackcap-migration-ed]: [Migration, it’s in their genes](https://elifesciences.org/digests/54462/migration-it-s-in-their-genes)

 Delmore et al.[^Delmore-2020] sequenced the genome of blackcaps to investigate the phylogeny of migratory behavior among these populations. The genomes of 110 blackcaps from several populations that take different annual migrations were analyzed. The analysis revealed that populations began to diverge in their migratory behavior \~30,000 years ago and that only a small set of genes code for their differences in migration. In particular, genetic differences underlying different migratory behavior tend to be in the parts of the genome that control whether a given gene is switched on or off rather than in the genes themselves.

For these reasons, (C. elegans) is ideal for studying information-processing mechanisms embedded in the neural network. This paper proposes a neural network model of C. elegans with the actual neural structure preserved to simulate the organism's attraction to sodium chloride (NaCl). To implement attractant behavior, the organism's neural network must calculate the temporal and spatial gradients of NaCl concentration; however, the mechanism behind this complex information processing in the worm's neural network has not yet been fully elucidated. As a first step to analyze the information processing mechanism, the parameters of the neural network model were adjusted using the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, and the neural network model was verified for its ability to generate temporal and spatial gradients. Simulation for neuron ablation experiment was then carried out, and the results exhibited same trends as the biological experiment indicating that our approach can be used to predict the results of biological experiments, and can therefore be used as a tool to provide guidelines for such experiments.)
