Damarland mole rats and Naked Mole rats


Lekking in wild turkeys. What is a lek? How can a male in a lek who never succeeds in mating with a female
nevertheless “benefit” by his participation? 

## Ultimate

## So what's the problem?

### Group-, Individual-, or Allele- Level Adaptation?

### Alternate models

#### Relatedness

References against this hypothesis:
- Nowack
- Wilson
- non-haplodiploidy

#### Reproductive Potential

Lekking example

#### Phylogenetic History

do sex role ratios reflect parental care or defense?

#### Arms Race


### Phylogeny

:::{epigraph}
Our results highlight the distinct origin of social behavior in Stenogastrinae, a group that provides an independent source of information concerning traits that promote eusociality... The dual acquisition of sociality in vespid wasps highlights the evolutionary importance of various traits, now seen as convergent, that play significant roles in the evolution of their sociality.

Hormonal

*These both imply that there is potential for either in all individuals*
