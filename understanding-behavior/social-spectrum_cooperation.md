# Grouping and Cooperation

There is a spectrum of social behavior that ranges from ***not solitary*** to ***eusocial***. The categories along this spectrum are shifty. The main concepts today are ***grouping*** and ***cooperation***.

### Case Study: An Insect’s Extreme Makeover

:::{admonition} MARTIN ENSERINK, Science 2004
*Schistocerca gregaria*, the desert locust, is a dull-looking, shy insect that tends to stay put, avoid other locusts, fly by night, and never cause trouble. And then there’s the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, a conspicuous yellow-and-black—or bright pink when not fully mature—thrill seeker that bands together in swarms of billions that cross vast distances in broad daylight and devour tons of vegetation in their path. 

So striking is the difference between the desert locust’s “solitary” and “gregarious” phases that it wasn’t until 1921 that Russian entomologist Boris Uvarov realized they were the same species. And only recently have scientists begun to piece together a detailed picture of how the insect switches from one phase to the other. University of Oxford entomologist Stephen Simpson, the uncontested leader in this small field, hopes that this understanding may eventually help prevent plagues. “The phase change is the defining feature of locust biology,” he says,“and also the main problem.”  

The makeover is the locust’s answer to harsh life in the desert, Simpson explains. Most of the time, the sparse vegetation can sustain only small numbers of desert locusts, and they do best by staying out of one another’s way. After intense rain, however, plant life explodes and locust numbers skyrocket; when the inevitable drought sets in, the insects find themselves coalescing in high numbers around shrinking food
supplies. This increased density is what triggers the shift from solitary to gregarious—presumably because, once they run out of food, the insects need to migrate and, like many species, they seek safety in numbers. 

Researchers have long known that the locust’s behavior is the first thing to change. A solitary locust becomes more attracted to its mates and more active after spending just 4 hours in a crowded cage, for instance. The spectacular morphological transformation, on the other hand, can take several generations to complete. 

When densities drop (for instance, when enough members of a swarm die) the process reverses.

Why migrate in groups?
- Dilution hypothesis (reduced risk of predation by being in group)?
- avoid getting separated?
- selfish herd (reduce risk of predation by putting other individuals between you and predator)?
- leader is better at finding the way?
- reduced energy? (but only for the followers?)

Wing-beat frequency and heart rate of pelicans engaged
in various types of flight (mean51 s.d.). Birds flying over a river
following a motor boat cruising at a constant speed of 48 km h11
flew at an average altitude of 1 m above the water, initially alone
at a distance from the boat (‘alone at 1 m’), but then joining other
birds in formation (‘in formation’). Numbering of circles indicates
the position in the formation, ‘1’ being the leader. In formation
flights, only birds in or behind the third position were used to
measure heart rate, to avoid the possible effects of motor-boat
turbulence on flight pattern. Wing-beat frequency of the lead and
second birds was measured in groups flying far from the boat.
Birds flying with an ultralight aeroplane cruising at 55–60 km h11
at an altitude of about 50 m were not able or willing to fly in the
wake of the aircraft, and generally flew at a distance, using a
flapping flight, at a speed of 45–50 km h11 (‘alone at 50 m’).
Pelicans following the plane finished their flight of 3 km with a
glide of 2–3 min (‘gliding’) before landing on the water. Heart
rates averaged 77.6515.2 beats per min (b.p.m.) when resting,
and reached 198.2518.7 and 204.9515.7 b.p.m. when
paddling in water and when walking, respectively.[^Weimerskirch-2001]

### Reading
- Meerkat vigilance 
- Barnacle geese [group size vigilance video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeJHW5n-PXY)

	In your notebook document the following:

	- Flock size
	- The number of times they are in the ‘head up’ position
	- The start and stop time of each ‘head up’ position.

<hr>

Do you think meerkats will be more or less vigilant in the presence of predators? Will their behavior vary depending on the type of predator?

Videos for Meerkat analysis
- [No Predator](https://vimeo.com/80600822)
- [Simulated Aerial Predator](https://vimeo.com/80600821)
- [Simulated Terrestrial Predator](https://vimeo.com/71877438)

Set a timer to go off every 10 seconds, and at each interval record the number of meerkats performing each behavior. We will use a modified ethogram that includes only three categories: vigilant, not vigilant or out of site.

Vigilant: Head raised at or above horizontal plain and eyes open (to include scanning /guarding / raised guarding). Not Vigilant: Eyes closed or head lower than horizontal plane (to include foraging, moving, sleeping, resting). Out of sight: Not visible by the researcher
