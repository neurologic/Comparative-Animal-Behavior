Oxytocin receptor levels do not change with parental care experience.

***Optogenetics*** is a technique used in neuroscience to enable the depolarization or hyperpolarization of specific neural populations in the brain. Ion channels that are ***gated by*** light of a specific wavelength can be expressed in specific sets of cells that are uniquely genetically defined. The light-gated ion channels can also be expressed in all cells within specific regions of the brain when injected locally in a viral vector.

They used expression of ChETA (using the sequence lox-stop-lox-ChETA) in PVN neurons of Oxt-IRES-Cre animals (expresses CRE under control of endogenous oxytocin, which is in PVN neurons).

With this method, they could depolarize PVN neurons at the cell body or depolarize PVN axon terminals in specific target regions (like the auditory cortex). ***This enables them to say something about the neural mechanism of parental care in addition to the hormonal mechanism.*** If they stimulated the PVN neuron cell bodies, then they would not know what part of the brain was being modulated as a result of the oxytocin release (PVN neurons release oxytocin via axons throughout the brain).

**A)** Percent of initially naive females that retrieve at least once during the first 12 hours of co-housing with experienced dams. **B)** Cumulative retrieval during co-housing under the three different conditions tested (systemic injection of oxytocin, release of endogenous oxytocin from PVN, and systemic injection of saline).

***Q2: What do you infer about the neural and hormonal mechanism of parental care based on the saline condition results?***

So what is oxytocin doing to the neurons in auditory cortex? What more specifically are neural mechanisms of parental care?

Neural and hormonal mechanisms of parental care. **A)** Increased maternal care (pup retrieval) is associated with a change in the neural encoding (response to) pup calls in the left auditory cortex. **C,D,E)** Changes in spike rate and temporal precision (trial-to-trial correlation in spiking activity pattern) is specific for pup calls rather than general to all auditory stimuli. **F)** Pairing pup calls with oxytocin release in the left auditory cortex (starting at time 0) is sufficient to induce neural responses like those in experienced Dams (black = average across both types of oxytocin administration). 
:::

Therefore, changes in parental care can be explained by long-lasting neural changes that are driven by (transiently) increased oxytocin levels in new mothers.

***Q3: Was monogamy or promiscuity the ancestral state of the last common ancestor of peromyscus? Provide a quantitative argument for your conclusion based on the principle of parsimony.*** 

***Q4: Based only on the results of Figure 3, how did the authors conclude that parental care behavior likely involves more than one gene?***

***Q5: Which behaviors are the most genetically linked with each other? Which Figure/Panel are you relying on most to decide this?***

***Q6: If you block AVP (use an antagonist to the receptors that endogenously exist) in maniculatus, do you predict that they will then make good nests or do you predict no change in their parental care behavior? WHy?***

***Q7: Based on the results presented in Bendesky et al 2017, would you infer that AVP receptor distribution was the same or different between the brains of P. polionotus and P. maniculatus? Why?***

So… Bendesky et all found a genetic polymorphism affecting a neuromodulator (hormone) that contributes to variation in parental behavior across species (ie. contributes to behavioral evolution of parental care).

## Evolutionary Mechanisms

From Lotem et al.
:::

"My model will be falsified if nestling discrimination is exhibited by hosts in which only the parasitic nestling remains in the nest, and if discrimination in this case is learned."

"The model does not explain why hosts cannot recognize their nestlings innately. But it is doubtful whether the common forms of innate recognition could be sufficiently effective to reject a single cuckoo nestling. An innate response to key releasers is often stimulated by a broad range of stimuli that only slightly resemble the 'correct' one."
