# Parental Care


## Neural Mechanisms

Oxytocin receptor levels do not change with parental care experience.

***Optogenetics*** is a technique used in neuroscience to enable the depolarization or hyperpolarization of specific neural populations in the brain. Ion channels that are ***gated by*** light of a specific wavelength can be expressed in specific sets of cells that are uniquely genetically defined. The light-gated ion channels can also be expressed in all cells within specific regions of the brain when injected locally in a viral vector.

They used expression of ChETA (using the sequence lox-stop-lox-ChETA) in PVN neurons of Oxt-IRES-Cre animals (expresses CRE under control of endogenous oxytocin, which is in PVN neurons).

With this method, they could depolarize PVN neurons at the cell body or depolarize PVN axon terminals in specific target regions (like the auditory cortex).

**A)** Percent of initially naive females that retrieve at least once during the first 12 hours of co-housing with experienced dams. **B)** Cumulative retrieval during co-housing under the three different conditions tested (systemic injection of oxytocin, release of endogenous oxytocin from PVN, and systemic injection of saline).

Neural and hormonal mechanisms of parental care. **A)** Increased maternal care (pup retrieval) is associated with a change in the neural encoding (response to) pup calls in the left auditory cortex. **C,D,E)** Changes in spike rate and temporal precision (trial-to-trial correlation in spiking activity pattern) is specific for pup calls rather than general to all auditory stimuli. **F)** Pairing pup calls with oxytocin release in the left auditory cortex (starting at time 0) is sufficient to induce neural responses like those in experienced Dams. 
:::

Therefore, changes in parental care can be explained by long-lasting neural changes that are driven by (transiently) increased oxytocin levels in new mothers.

***Q: If you block avp in maniculatus (antagonist to the receptors that endogenously exist) then will they make good nests?***

***Q: Based on these results from Bendesky et al 2017, what would you infer about the distribution of AVP receptors in the brain of P. polionotus compared to P. maniculatus? (same avp receptor distribution or different?)***
