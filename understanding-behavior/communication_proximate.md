# Communication: Proximate

Communication can broadly be defined as when a signal from a ***sender*** affects the behavior of the ***receiver***. Communication is essential for coordinating social behaviors including courtship, mating, parenting, rivalry, and alarm signaling. However, communication can occur in a variety of modalities.

***Q1: What makes good communication? What steps/processes are required in the sender and the receiver?***  

## Auditory

### CPGs

*Xenopus* is a frog genus which has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms and evolution of vertebrate social behaviors, especially communication. 

The basic vocal unit of all Xenopus calls is a brief sound pulse; these pulses are then combined into a variety of temporal patterns that have social meanings.[^xenopus-vocal-mech] Each pulse is generated by two "arytenoid discs" in the larynx being rapidly pulled apart.

[^xenopus-vocal-mech]: Because of its evolutionary history of return to water from
land, Xenopus have evolved a specialized mechanism of sound production within the larynx. The sound-producing elements are two tightly apposed arytenoid cartilage discs at the anterior end of the larynx. Action potentials of axons in laryngeal nerves leads to simultaneous contraction of paired bipennate muscles connected to the discs by tendons. Contraction generates rapid separation of the discs, which creates a single pulse of sound as the larynx vibrates within the thorax, effectively coupled to the body and the surrounding water.[^Kelley-et-al-2020]

Serotonin (5-HT) plays a crucial role in initiating vocalization. Exogenous application to the brain promotes the advertisement calling motor neuron pattern of activity, as does elevating endogenous serotonin levels using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Endogenous serotonin thus contributes to call initiation.

The vocal repertoire of *X. laevis* is sexually differentiated and specific to social context.[^Kelley-et-al-2020] The male advertisement call consists of individual sound pulses at fast (60 pps) and slow (30 pps) rates. Males produce advertisement calls when alone or with conspecifics. When oviposition is imminent, females produce a rapid (16 pps) series of sound pulses known as rapping. Rapping serves as an acoustic aphrodisiac and stimulates male answer calling. When clasped, sexually unreceptive females extend their hind legs and produce the slower ticking call (6 pps). A male clasping another frog, male or female, produces the amplectant call. A clasped male responds with growling. During the social interactions that precede one male vocally suppressing another, males produce the chirping call. Modified from Zornik and Kelley, 2011. pps: pulses per second.

In *Xenopus laevis*, vocal signals differ between the sexes, through development, and across the genus, reflecting evolutionary divergence in sensory and motor circuits that can be interrogated mechanistically.

A vocal CPG underlies divergent vocalizations in X. laevis and X. petersii.  The vocal motor nucleus (n) IX–X contains vocal motor neurons. These neurons send their axons via the vocal (laryngeal) nerve to the larynx, the vocal effector organ. Fictive calling can be recorded from the vocal nerve using a suction electrode. Premotor neurons in the Xenopus PBX project monosynaptically to the vocal motor nucleus. In PBX, whole-cell electrodes can record activity associated with fictive calling. [^Barkan-2018]

A similar type of CPG has been found in midshipman fish.

***Q2: How are these vocal CPGs different than the CPGs you have considered for cricket chirping and quadripedal locomotion?***

***Q3: In human speech, what are the basic patterns of muscle activation that are likely encoded by neurons or neural circuits in the brain? Do they require circuits like locomotion or chirping? Or could they get away with single neurons like frog and midshipman fish?***

### Sensory-motor transformations

In X. laevis, calls can be evoked and modified by acoustic and other sensory signals in both sexes. How does auditory input access neural elements that in turn generate an appropriate vocal response; how is perception linked to production?

In *Xenopus*, researchers have identified a key forebrain node that links auditory and vocal production circuits to match socially appropriate vocal responses to acoustic features of male and female calls.

Males respond to female rapping by increasing advertisement calling and initiating answer calling. The central nucleus of the amygdala is a strong candidate for a role in auditory-guided, endocrine-responsive, vocal communication. It receives input from the auditory processing pathways of the brain and projects to parabrachial nucleus (PB) where CPG neurons are located. 

Males with damaged CeA call spontaneously (so they are not mute). They also respond to advertisement calls with prolonged vocal suppression, so they are not deaf and can produce the socially appropriate response to a dominant male. However, while ticking normally evokes transient vocal suppression in males, CeA-lesioned males respond with prolonged vocal suppression. Rapping evokes answer calling in intact males but CeA-lesioned males respond to rapping with prolonged vocal suppression. Prolonged vocal suppression should only be evoked by the calls of dominant males, not by ticking or rapping. Even when tested with an actual rapping female, males do not answer call. ***Damage to the CeA thus results in socially inappropriate responses of males to female, but not to male, calls***.

### Learned versus Innate

The behavioral trait typically studied as “vocal learning” involves “the influence of auditory information, including feedback, on vocal development” (Nottebohm, 1972).

Vocal-learning species share the presence of: 
- a critical period for learning
- babbling
- deafness-induced deterioration of learned vocalizations
- dialects
- brain circuits that control production and learning of vocalizations. 

In humans, there is a language-related brain network involving multiple functional circuits. It is well established that Broca's area in the left frontal lobe and Wernicke's area in the left temporal lobe are central brain regions in this network7 (Fig. 1a). Among other functions, Broca's area is involved in speech production and generation and processing of language syntax, while Wernicke's area plays a major role in speech perception and comprehension. In the songbird brain, there is a similar neural dissociation, with a neural network for song production (the ‘song system’, including the song nucleus HVC, used as a proper noun) and brain regions that are involved in song perception and recognition (including the caudomedial nidopallium, NCM). Thus in a functional sense, these networks are considered to be analogous to Broca's and Wernicke's areas in humans, respectively.[^Moorman-2015]

Similar critical brain regions underlying auditory communication in humans and songbirds.

Vocal-learning brain circuits include striatal (Figure 117, pink) as well as cortical (Figure 117, green) vocal brain regions, a loop of synaptic connections among cortical and striatal regions (Figure 117, white arrows), and a unique direct connection from motor cortical areas (human laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) and songbird robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA)) to brainstem vocal motor and respiratory neurons for phonation (Figure 117, red arrow).

Sagittal (looking sideways at the head) slices of the brain of humans and song-learning birds ( ie. songbird, parrot, and hummingbird) as well as vocal-nonlearning nonhuman primates (macaque) and birds (dove and quail).  
Songbird Area X, a striatal region necessary for vocal learning, is most similar to a part of the human striatum activated during speech production. The RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) analog of song-learning birds, necessary for song production, is most similar to laryngeal motor cortex regions in humans that control speech production. Red arrows show the direct projections found only in vocal learners, from vocal motor cortex regions to brainstem vocal motor neurons. Forebrain song nuclei are absent in vocal non-learning species.[^Pfenning-2015]

The idea of innateness of behaviors has directly fostered the search for central pattern generators that govern the stridulation patterns of crickets, katydids or grasshoppers.
