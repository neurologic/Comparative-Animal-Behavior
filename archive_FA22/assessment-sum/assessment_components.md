## Section 1

Herring gull chicks need help obtaining food. They have a stereotyped "begging" behavior: when chicks see their parent's head, they peck at the beak. The pecking then causes their parents to regurgitate partially-digested food that the chicks can eat ([though I guess the results are not guaranteed to please](https://youtu.be/a-ek4225__I)). The hunger level of the chicks can also effect the liklihood that they will beg (their motivation to beg). Tinbergen and Perdeck tested a wide variety of herring gull features to determine sign stimuli for begging[^tinbergen-gulls-1950]. Figure 1 shows the results of a small subset of their experiment for you to examine. 

[^tinbergen-gulls-1950]: No need to read it to complete this exam, but here is the reference if you are interested:	[Tinbergen, N., & Perdeck, A. C. (1950).

**Figure 1:** Results from one of Tinbergen and Perdeck's experiments on the begging behavior of herring gull chicks. Each of the three stimuli (models of a gull head) were presented to chicks. Tinbergen and Perdeck counted the number of pecks directed toward each stimulus during a 30 second period. They then calculated and reported the peck rate (purple). The stimulus on the left was the "standard" stimulus meant to mimick multiple features of the adult herring gull head. The standard stimulus served as the control stimulus in the experiment. Note that the peck rate reported for each experimental stimulus (middle and right columns) was *normalized* to the standard stimulus: the absolute peck rate for each experimental stimulus was divided by the absolute peck rate to the standard stimulus and then multiplied by 100. 

***Q1 (2 points): What two features of the adult herring gull head are being dissociated (and therefore independently tested) in this experiment?***

***Q2 (1 point): What metric was used to quantify begging behavior in this experiment?***

***Q3 (4 points): Given the experiment and results described/depicted in Figure 1, answer the following:  
		- Which of the two stimulus features tested serves as the stronger sign stimulus for gull chick begging (refer to your answer to Q1 for the two stimulus features tested)?  
		- What evidence (data) support your interpretation?*** 

***Q4 (2 points): Predict the results of the same experiment if the chicks tested were more hungry. Concisely explain your reasoning.***

**Figure 2:** Examples of behavior expression in two scenarios (A and B) depiced using a Lorenz-style model. FAP=fixed action pattern. a.u.=arbitrary units. 


Compare the two scenarios (**A** and **B**) in Figure 2 to answer the following questions. 

***Q5 (3 points). The stimulus threshold at time=4 was:    
		- higher in A.  
		- higher in B.  
		- the same in both A and B.  
Choose one of these answers and then briefly explain the evidence for your choice and your reasoning.***

***Q6 (3 points). The stimulus strength at time=4 was:    
		- stronger in A compared to B.  
		- weaker in A compared to B.  
		- the same in both A and B.  
Choose one of these answers and then briefly explain the evidence for your choice and your reasoning.***


## Section 3

***Q7 (6 points): Respond to each of the following by refering back to [your analysis of the experiment used to test sign stimuli for stickleback fish aggression](stickleback-aggression-analysis) :  
		- Which independent stimulus feature that you analyzed was the strongest for evoking/triggering aggression (bites)?  
		- Which independent stimulus feature that you analyzed was the weakest for evoking/triggering aggression (bites)?   
		- What evidence do you have to support your answers?***

## Section 4

***Q8 (3 points): Based your observation of the egg-rolling behavior in the videos we watched during class ([video 1](https://youtu.be/7PcteKRA3zs) and [video 2](https://youtu.be/vUNZv-ByPkU)), address the following in your response: (Note that there are a variety of correct answers to this question):  
		- What do you think is a sign stimulus (a stimulus feature) that triggers/evokes the FAP of egg-rolling.  
		- What observation(s) led you to formulate that hypothesis?  
		- Briefly describe an experiment that would enable you to gather evidence for/against that hypotheses.***
