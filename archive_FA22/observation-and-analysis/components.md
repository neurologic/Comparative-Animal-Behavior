## Units of behavior

:::{admonition} Why?
Attention to the way we define behavior for a particular study must include considering the appropriate organizational level and timescales for our level of analysis and our question (ultimate versus proximate, neural versus genetic, etc).

### Movemes, Actions, Activities

The nested levels of organization that you just explored are examples of *hierarchy*. The hierarchical nature of behavior seems clear, despite a lack of concensus for terminology used to describe its component parts[^AndersonPerona2014][^Datta2019].

[^AndersonPerona2014]: David J.Anderson and Pietro Perona [Toward a Science of Computational Ethology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.005). Neuron 84:1 (2014).

[^Datta2019]: Datta SR, Anderson DJ, Branson K, Perona P, Leifer A [Computational Neuroethology: A Call to Action](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.09.038). Neuron 104:11-24 (2019). 

The following figure depicts and describes challenges that arise from the hierarchical nature of behavior that we need to grapple with when we study it.

Center (mouse cartoons): A characteristic sequence of behaviors exhibited by a mouse in its home cage as it moves around the walls (**thigmotaxis**), approaches some food, eats, and then sleeps. Several key challenges facing any segmentation of continuous behavior into components are illustrated, including the following two points.  
**1)** Behaviors need to be labeled, which raises the problem of *lumping* versus *splitting* (red); for example, mice engage in thigmotaxis (behaviors in which the mouse exhibits locomotion and turning behaviors that are deterministically sequenced to generate an action where the animal circumnavigates its cage). Is thigmotaxis a *singular* or unitary behavior (because its elements are deterministically linked during its expression), or it is a *sequence* of walking, turning, and walking behaviors?  
**2)** Should behavior be considered at a single timescale that serially progresses or instead considered a hierarchical process organized at multiple timescales simultaneously (blue)? When the mouse is sniffing and running at the same time, is that a *compositional* behavior whose *basis set* includes **run** and **sniff**, or is **running+sniffing** a fundamentally new behavior (purple)?[^Datta2019]
:::

***Q7: How would you define 'hierarchy' in the context of animal behavior?***

The following language, as defined by Anderson and Perona[^AndersonPerona2014], provides a reasonable basis for discussion of the hierarchical nature of behavior. 

:::{glossary}

Moveme  
	The simplest meaningful pattern associated with a behavior. Typically involves a short, ballistic trajectory described by a verb, such as a *turn*, a *step*, or a *wing extension*, which cannot be further decomposed. It is analogous to a *phoneme* in language.

Action  
	A combination of movemes that always occurs in the same stereotypical sequence and that is also described by a verb. Examples of actions include **walk** (*step* + *step* + *step*), **thigmotaxis** (*walk* + *turn* + *walk*), etc. In language, it would be analogous to a *word* or to an idiomatic *expression*.

Activity  
	A species-characteristic concatenation of actions and movemes whose structure is typical, ranging from stereotyped to variable. Variability can be observed both in the structure or dynamics of the individual actions that comprise an activity, as well as in the timing and/or sequence of the actions. Examples of activities include *nest-building*, *parenting*, etc.

:::

***Q8: How do these categories defined by Anderson and Perona map onto the categories that you came up with earlier? Any thoughts?***

***Q9: Pick an animal that you are familiar with (do not spend too much time deliberating over which animal to use). Make an example behavior hierarchy for that animal using either your group's own hierarchical categories, or the "moveme, action, and activity" hierarchical categories. Do not include all behavior of the animal, just enough to make an example hierarchy of behavior. Diagram the behavior hierarchy and define each behavior that you included at each level. (Do not use any of the examples already given in the figure above).***

### Fixed Action Patterns (FAP)[^instinctive-motor-pattern][^fap], Releasing Mechanisms, and Sign Stimuli

[^instinctive-motor-pattern]: In *Here am I. Where are You?* (1988), Lorenz uses the term 'instinctive motor pattern' instead.

[^fap]: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_action_pattern)


:::{admonition} Why?
Once you have defined individual behaviors, you can determine what behavior an animal is doing at each moment in time. AND what that animal is *not* doing at that moment in time. Essentially, behaviors compete for expression and an animal's motivation, its life history, and its external environment determine which wins. The Nobel laureate [Konrad Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Lorenz) laid the foundations for an approach to studying animal behavior and categorized behavior into *Fixed Action Pattern* components that are released by *Sign Stimuli*.
:::

:::{glossary}
Fixed Action Patterns (FAPs) 
   In a general sense, FAPs are identifiable behaviors. Historically, the term FAP has been used to mean *instinctive*, but that distinction may not be so necessary/useful[^FAPdefinition]. At an extreme, FAPs are very *stereotyped*.
:::

[^FAPdefinition]: Historically, behaviors are considered FAPs when they are *instinctual* (ie. genetically-determined and *pre-programmed*). Lorenz used the German word 'Erbkoordination' which translates literally as 'inherited co-ordination' to describe them. In a more contemporary mindset, we can think of *behavioral patterns* that need not be purely *pre-programmed* (as you will learn in this course if you have not already... no behavior truly is).

:::{index} egg rolling
:::

*Egg Rolling* is a common example of FAPs used in introductory animal behavior courses. Female gulls sit on their eggs in the nest to incubate them. Sometimes, the eggs roll out of the nest. The gull, noticing an egg outside of the nest, performs the *egg rolling* behavior in response. As a class, let's watch these two videos of egg rolling:
- [egg rolling video 1](https://youtu.be/7PcteKRA3zs)
- [egg rolling video 2](https://youtu.be/vUNZv-ByPkU)

:::{index} stickleback aggression
:::
Territorial *aggression behavior* in stickleback fish is another common "introductory animal behavior course" example of FAPs[^intro-stickleback]. During the breeding season, the male fish select a territory on which they build a nest. When a male stickleback spots another nearby male in his nesting territory, he will launch into FAP aggressive displays designed to scare off the stranger. However, males are not aggressive to nearby females in their territory. 

[^intro-stickleback]: For example, see the landing page for 'innate behavior' from [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/ecology-ap/responses-to-the-environment/a/innate-behaviors). However, note that the reference for this result is a textbook, not [the original article](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1938-03659-001). The data from the [publication in German](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01422.x) is not available. Based on replications of the original experiments, it turns out that [Tinbergen's results from the 1937 paper may be less clear](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534445#metadata_info_tab_contents).

***Q1: If aggressive FAPs should only be directed toward other males, what sensory cues could be used to appropriately trigger (or suppress) FAP expression?***

To test what *stimulus* (sensory cues/features) triggers aggression FAPs, we need to quantify the behavior somehow. A *bite* is a component of aggression, and a commonly used measure of aggression is ***bite rate***. For this study, let's define a ***bite*** as *contact of the male's mouth against an object*. 

***Q2: Mathematically define 'bite rate' (ie. how would you calculate it?).***

***Q3: If bite rate was a good metric of aggression, would you predict that the bite rate of a male stickleback fish would be higher in the presence of another male or another female?***

:::{index} double: motivation ; stimulus strength 
:::

We can think of action-specific energy as the *motivation* for a particular behavior (FAP). Both internal drive and external stimuli contribute to this motivation. The *strength* of a stimulus is defined in terms of how much it changes the action specific potential for a FAP. 

As an analogy, let's consider eating behavior. The liklihood that you will eat a food can depend on the properties of the food itself (food preferences effect eating behavior). 

:::{figure-md} stimulus-strength-food
:class: figure

Relationship between variation in food taste and desire to eat food. 
:::

Think about your own food preferences and whether a sweet food be a strong or weak stimulus for eating. Then, imagine you are are really really really hungry (ie. increased *internal drive* to eat), would you be more or less likely to eat in response to a weak food stimulus compared to when you are full?  
Why (in terms of Lorenz's model)?
