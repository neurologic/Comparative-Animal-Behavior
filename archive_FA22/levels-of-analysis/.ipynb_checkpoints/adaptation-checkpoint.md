# Adaptation

Assumption: behavior is an adaptation to changing needs and a changing environment that maximizes fitness. 

In evolutionary terms, fitness is defined as the population frequency of the allele underlying the trait. 

***Q: An individual with allele 'A' has low body weight and is constantly sick. An individual with allele 'B' has high body weight and never gets sick. Individual A has 5 offspring. Individual B has no offspring. Which allele has a higher fitness?***

***Q: Allele A of a gene leads to territorial behavior and a higher number of mates. Allele 'B' of the same gene leads to 'sneaky' behavior with fewer mates, but more offspring than allele 'A.' Which allele has a greater fitness?***

*Factors* that effect an animal's fitness.

***Q: What does an animal's fitness depend on?***
