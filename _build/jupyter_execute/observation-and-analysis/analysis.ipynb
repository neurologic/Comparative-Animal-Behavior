    "For any sequence of non-independent events in the world, and where a limited number of outcomes can occur, conditional probabilities can be computed relating each outcome to one another. Often this simply takes the form of counting how often certain outcomes follow one another in an observed sequence, and normalizing by the total number of transitions to calculate a probability. \n",
