A phylogeny is a study of the relationships among a group of organisms. Animals that evolved from a common ancestor evolve in different ways. They also develop different traits at different times. Every species can be connected to one common ancestor that they all evolved from. In this case, phylogeny is used on rattlesnakes. (Figure 1) The rattlesnakes were investigated for showing the trait of cannibalistic behavior or not showing the trait. Out of many species, only 6 show cannibalistic behavior. For the species that do show the trait, they seem to come up in very distant relationships. Very few of the species that are close in evolution share the trait. Also, based on just the phylogeny the ancestral trait can be predicted. An ancestral trait is a trait that the very first ancestor, that the species evolved from, shows. In this case, the ancestral trait is cannibalistic behavior because the species â€œSistrurus catenatus has a direct lineage to the common ancestor. This species does show cannibal-like behavior thus the ancestral trait is cannibalism.

Infanticide has a high benefit and a low cost. The high benefit is because eating a snake's offspring can bring a lot of nutrients into the snake's diet. Some snakes eat their young because they need to compensate for their lost energy when producing offspring. The cost is low because it is easy for the snake to eat their young, there is very little risk to the parent snake itself since the offspring has no means of defending itself. Since the benefit outweighs the cost this is a viable option and could explain why rattlesnakes partake in cannibalism. The main benefit of infanticide is not losing the energy that went into reproduction.

## Making connections


:::{epigraph}

In a study (Herr et al 2017) there was shown to be a relationship between a stress hormone and the defensiveness of a snake. The snake that showed this behavior was the cottonmouth. The fire trials recorded the snakes and obtained blood samples to quantify the plasma CORT concentrations when first encountering another snake and then after 30 minutes. The cottonmouth snakes with a higher baseline of CORT centration were more likely to strike during an initial encounter with a predator than snakes with a lower baseline CORT level. Snakes with lower CORT levels were more likely to engage in threat displays without striking. Other studies
show that animals living in areas with a lot of predators tend to have higher baseline glucocorticoid concentrations. Having these higher hormone baselines set up the animal for fast and anti-predator behavior such as striking. A possible prediction for snake cannibalism could be that a snake has higher hormone levels that set them up to be aggressive and partake in more defensive-type behaviors like combat. The hormones explain why a snake would attack and eat one of its own.

- How does this explanation relate to the Lorenz model of behavior?
- What is the FAP in this example? What is the sign stimulus?
- What does the hormone levels do to the sign stimulus threshold? Draw a plot that relates these two variables.
