# Observation

:::{admonition} Why?
Scientists use human perceptions, intuition, and feelings, our inner worlds, to forge novel, testable hypotheses about those of other species.

## Ethograms

:::{admonition} Why?

Observations of animal behavior cannot be used to advance our understanding unless the language is clearly and objectively defined in a way that is recognized by the broader community. 

You have already watched [this short video](https://vimeo.com/80600819) and named/defined all of the distinct behaviors that you observe.  
Now, compare your notes among your group and develop an ethogram including both *behavioral actions* and *definitions for each behavior/action*.

***Q: Consolidate your individual work into a final group ethogram (behavior names and definitions). Include ‘other’ and ‘out of view’ as two of your behaviors.***

***Q: Were the behaviors that you and your group originally listed different? In what ways? How different?***

## Activity Budgets

Do some behaviors happen more than others? Why might some behaviors happen more than others? The *activity* budget of an animal/species is the distribution of time allocated across its behaviors.

As an illustration of the activity budget concept, consider the following poem.

:::{epigraph} 
One fish two fish red fish blue fish.

***Q: How many possible words are there (given the poem)?***

***Q: As an analogy to behavior, what is the 'activity budget' for each word in this poem?***

***Q: What activity budget would you expect by chance for each word in this poem?***

***Q: What 'activity budget' would you expect 'by chance' for each behavior in an ethogram? Calculate this 'null hypothesis' for an animal with an ethogram of 5 behaviors: X, Y, Z, A, and P.*** 


Animal behaviorists use ethograms to determine an animal's *activity budget*. Now that you have your ethogram of meerkat behavior, you will estimate a meerkat activity budget. You will watch a new video of meerkat behavior in which you focus on recording the behavior of a single individual. *You will record the start time of each behavior and the behavior name.* It is helpful to develop a short code that you can use for each behavior category (e.g. drinking could be denoted with a ‘D’). You can take the initial data using any format you choose (e.g. I used a pen and paper) and you can subsequently enter your data into an electronic spreadsheet if it is helpful for you.

Use the following format for your data record:

| **Behavior** | **Start time** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name of behavior | cummulative seconds | calculated | 

***Q: Which of these columns needs to be filled out during data collection? Which of these columns can be filled out "offline" (after data collection has concluded)?***

***Q: How would you calculate the duration of each instance of each behavior from your data?***

Activity budgets are generally presented as the proportion or percent time that an animal spends doing each behavior. 

***Q: Come up with an equation that you could use to calcualte the activity budget for each behavior in your ethogram.***

***Q: Would you include or exclude the time spent 'out of sight' in the reported activity budget? Justify your choice.***

***Q: Would you include or exclude the time spent doing 'other' behaviors in the reported activity budget? Justify your choice.***

In [this 10-minute video](https://vimeo.com/80602697), one meerkat (Bumble) is highlighted throughout. Focus on Bumble's behavior to create a meerkat activity budget. Each person in the group needs to record their own data based on video observation.

***Q: Enter the results of your activity budget calculations here.***

***Q: How would you visually depict/present the activity budget data? Draw a sketch.***

***Q: How similar or different were your results from your partners?***

## Changing priorities

***Q: Do you think the activity budget is something that is a "constant" for each animal or species or do you think it is something that "varies"? Why? And over what timescale?***

***Q: What might effect an animal's activity budget?***

***Q: Pose at least two alternate hypotheses about meerkat behavior and predictions of those hypotheses that could be tested by calculating and comparing activity budgets under different experimental conditions.***
