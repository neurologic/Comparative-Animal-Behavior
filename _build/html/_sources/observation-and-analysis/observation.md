# Observation

## Ethogram Construction

Your first task will be to watch [this short video](https://vimeo.com/80600819). While you watch the video, document all of the different behaviors that you observe. 

After you watch the video, compare your notes and develop an ethogram with your partner including both *behavioral actions* and *definitions for each behavior/action*.

***Q: Please write out your ethogram (behavioral categories and definitions) here. Include ‘other’ and ‘out of view’ as two of your behaviors.***

***Q: Were the behaviors that you and your partner originally listed different?***


## Activity Budgets

How do animals spend their time? Animal behaviorists use ethograms to determine an animal's *activity budget*. 

Now that you have your ethogram of meerkat behavior, you will determine a meerkat activity budget. Both you and your partner will watch [this 10-minute video](https://vimeo.com/80602697) in which one meerkat (Bumble) is highlighted throughout. You will record the start time of each behavior and the behavior name. It is helpful to develop a short code that you can use for each behavior category (e.g. drinking could be denoted with a ‘D’). You can take the initial data using any format you choose (e.g. I used a pen and paper) and you can subsequently enter your data into an electronic spreadsheet if it is helpful for you.

Use the following format for your data record:

| **Behavior** | **Start time** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name of behavior | cummulative seconds | calculated | 

***Q: Which of these columns needs to be filled out during data collection? Which of these columns can be filled out "offline" (after data collection has concluded)?***

***Q: How will you calculate the duration of each instance of each behavior?***

Activity budgets are generally presented as the proportion or percent time that an animal spends in a particular activity. 

***Q: What equation would you use to calcualte the activity budget for each behavior in your ethogram?***

***Q: Would you include or exclude the time spent 'out of sight' in the reported activity budget?***

***Q: Would you include or exclude the time spent doing 'other' behaviors in the reported activity budget?*** 

***Q: Enter the results of your activity budget calculations here.***

***Q: How would you visually depict/present the activity budget data? Draw a rough sketch (or make an electronic illustration if available to you)***

***Q: How similar or different were your results from your partners?***

## Changing priorities

***Q: Do you think the activity budget is something that is a "constant" for each animal or species or do you think it is something that "varies"? Why? And over what timescale? ***

***Q: What might effect an animal's activity budget?***

***Q: Pose at least two alternate hypotheses about meerkat behavior and predictions of those hypotheses that could be tested by calculating and comparing activity budgets under different experimental conditions.***
