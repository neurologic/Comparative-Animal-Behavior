# Analysis

## Focal versus scan sampling

***Q: You are interested in how manakin birds sequence behavioral actions during courtship rituals. Would it be more appropriate to use focal or scan sampling? Why?*** 

***Q: You are interested in the activity budget of african elephants under captive versus wild conditions. Would it be more appropriate to use focal or scan sampling? Why?*** 

## Continuous versus interval sampling

***Q: Would it be better to use continuous or interval sampling when recording the behavior of multiple animals simultaneously? Better in what way? What would be a downside of that sampling method choice?***

## Changing priorities influence motivation: case study on vigilance

Watch [this clip](https://vimeo.com/80600820) of meerkats engaging in vigilance behaviors. 

**Vigilant**: Head raised at or above horizontal plain and eyes open. 

***Q: What function could vigilance serve?***

To test whether vigilance functions in avoiding predation, you will quantify behavior based on a simplified ethogram including three behaviors:
1. vigilant (head raised at or above horizontal plain and eyes open)
2. not vigilant (eyes closed or head lower than horizontal plane) 
3. out of sight (not visible by you, the researcher)

You will watch three different videos, each with a different *predator* treatment condition.
- [No predator](https://vimeo.com/80600822)
- [Terrestrial predator](https://vimeo.com/71877438)
- [Aerial predator](https://vimeo.com/80600821)

Set a timer to go off every 10 seconds, and at each interval record the number of meerkats performing each behavior. 

***Q: Use your results to present an argument for or against the hypothesis that "vigilance serves an anti-predator function" and that "vigilance is more useful against terrestrial predators"***

***Q: What other function(s) did you hypothesize for vigilance? How would you test another possible function that you posed?***

Next, you will use continuous focal sampling to investigate whether the proximity of a detected predator influences the activity budget of meerkat behavior. Again, you will consider 'vigilant', 'not vigilant', and 'out of sightâ€™ as the three behaviors comprising the ethogram for this study. Data should be collected for ONE meerkat at each distance of predator presentation (0 m, 2 m, 4 m, 6 m, 8 m, 10 m, 12 m, 14 m). Record the start time of each behaviour on a new line as shown:

| **Behavior** | **Start time** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name of behavior | cummulative seconds | calculated | 

We will want 3 repititions (different observers) of the analysis at each distance. 

***Q: What behavioral metric (based on your continuous sampling data) do you propose to calculate to test if predator proximity influences the trade-off between vigilant and non vigilant behavior (activity budget)? Define any relevant mathematical equation(s) for your calculation(s).***

Watch [the video clip](https://vimeo.com/77501205) corresponding to the distance you are responsible for and collect your data. 
| distance | start time in video |
| ---| --- | 
| 14m | 0:10 |
| 12m | 3:11 |
| 10m | 6:32 |
| 8m | 9:39 |
| 6m | 12:46 |
| 4m | 15:52 |
| 2m | 18:58 |
| 0m | 22:01 |

We can carry out a Spearman rank correlation test to see if there is a relationship between predator distance and vigilance behaviour.

***Q: Carry out the same experiment, but use an interval scan sampling method instead. For simplicity, collect data only for the following distances: 14, 10, 6, 2m). Create a figure to clearly report your results. Clearly describe your sampling protocol/method. Define any calculations that you did on the raw data.***
