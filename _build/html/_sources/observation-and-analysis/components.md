## Units of behavior

:::{admonition} Why?
Attention to the way we define behavior for a particular study must include considerting appropriate organizationals level and timescales for our level of analysis and our question (ultimate versus proximate, neural versus genetic, etc).

### Movemes, Actions, Activities

The *levels of organization* that you just explored are examples of *hierarchy*. The hierarchical nature of behavior seems clear, despite a lack of concensus for terminology used to describe its component parts[^AndersonPerona2014][^Datta2019].

[^AndersonPerona2014]: David J.Anderson and Pietro Perona [Toward a Science of Computational Ethology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.005). Neuron 84:1 (2014).

The following figure presents challenges that arise from the hierarchical nature of behavior that we need to grapple with when we study it.

A characteristic sequence of behaviors exhibited by a mouse in its home cage as it moves around the walls (thigmotaxis), approaches some food, eats, and then sleeps (center, mouse cartoons). Several key challenges facing any segmentation of continuous behavior into components are illustrated, including the following two points. **1)** Behaviors need to be labeled, which raises the problem of ‘‘lumping’’ versus ‘‘splitting’’ (red); for example, mice engage in thigmotaxis, behaviors in which the mouse exhibits locomotion and turning behaviors that are deterministically sequenced to generate an action where the animal circumnavigates its cage. Is thigmotaxis a singular or unitary behavior (because its elements are deterministically linked during its expression), or it is a sequence of walking, turning, and walking behaviors? **2)** Should behavior be considered at a single timescale that serially progresses or instead considered a hierarchical process organized at multiple timescales simultaneously (blue)? When the mouse is sniffing and running at the same time, is that a compositional behavior whose basis set includes ‘‘run’’ and ‘‘sniff,’’ or is ‘‘running+sniffing’’ a fundamentally new behavior (purple)?[^Datta2019]
:::

***Q: Define 'hierarchy' in the context of animal behavior.***

The following language as defined by Anderson and Perona[^AndersonPerona2014] provides a reasonable basis for discussion of the hierarchical nature of behavior. 

:::{glossary}

Moveme  
	The simplest meaningful pattern associated with a behavior. Typically involves a short, ballistic trajectory described by a verb, such as a turn, a step, or a wing extension, which cannot be further decomposed. It is analogous to a “phoneme” in language.

Action  
	A combination of movemes that always occurs in the same stereotypical sequence and that is also described by a verb. Examples of actions include “walk” (step + step + step), thigmotaxis (walk + turn + walk), etc. In language, it would be analogous to a word or to an idiomatic expression.

Activity  
	A species-characteristic concatenation of actions and movemes whose structure is typical, ranging from stereotyped to variable. Variability can be observed both in the structure or dynamics of the individual actions that comprise an activity, as well as in the timing and/or sequence of the actions. Examples of activities include nest-building, parenting, etc.

:::

***Q: How do these categories map onto the categories that you came up with earlier? Any thoughts?***

***Q: Pick an animal that you are familiar with (do not spend too much time deliberating over which animal to use). Make an example behavior hierarchy for that animal using either your hierarchical categories, or the moveme, action, and activity hierarchical categories. Do not include all behavior of the animal, just enough to make an example hierarchy of behavior. Diagram the behavior hierarchy and define each behavior that you included at each level. (Do not use any of the examples already given in the figure above).***

### Fixed Action Patterns (FAP)[^instinctive-motor-pattern][^fap], Releasing Mechanisms, and Sign Stimuli

[^instinctive-motor-pattern]: In *Here am I. Where are You?* (1988), Lorenz uses the term 'instinctive motor pattern' instead.

[^fap]: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_action_pattern)

:::{index} fixed action patterns
:::

:::{admonition} Why?
Once you have defined individual behaviors, you can determine what behavior an animal is doing at each moment in time. AND what is that animal *not* doing at that moment in time? Why? What causes a particular behavioral expression over another and what modulates behavioral decisions?
:::

:::{glossary}
Fixed Action Patterns  
  (FAPs) In a general sense, identifiable behaviors. Historically, the term FAP has been used to mean *instinctive*, but that distinction may not be so necessary/useful[^FAPdefinition]. At an extreme, FAPs are very *stereotyped*.
:::

[^FAPdefinition]: Historically, behaviors are considered FAPs when they are *instinctual* (ie. genetically-determined and *pre-programmed*). Lorenz used the German word 'Erbkoordination' which translates literally as 'inherited co-ordination' to describe them. In a more contemporary mindset, we can think of *behavioral patterns* that need not be purely *pre-programmed* (as you will learn in this course if you have not already... no behavior truly is).

*Egg Rolling* is a common example of FAPs used in introductory animal behavior courses. Female gulls sit on their eggs in the nest to incubate them. Sometimes, the eggs roll out of the nest. The gull, noticing an egg outside of the nest, performs the *egg rolling* behavior in response. As a class, let's watch these two videos of egg rolling:
- [egg rolling video 1](https://youtu.be/7PcteKRA3zs)
- [egg rolling video 2](https://youtu.be/vUNZv-ByPkU)

Another common "introductory animal behavior course" FAP example is territorial aggression behavior in stickleback fish[^intro-stickleback]. During the breeding season, the male fish select a territory on which they build a nest. When a male stickleback spots another nearby male in his nesting territory, he will launch into a FAP involving aggressive displays designed to scare off the stranger. However, males are not aggressive to nearby females in their territory.

Stickleback fish appearance. Top: female. Bottom: male.
:::

***Q: What differences do you notice between the appearance of males and females?***

***Q: If aggressive FAPs should only be elicited by the presence of other males, what sensory cues could be used to appropriately trigger FAP expression?***

To test what *stimulus* (sensory cues/features) triggers aggression FAPs, we need to quantify the behavior somehow. *Bite rate* is commonly used as a metric.
A *bite* is a component of aggression and can be defined as *contact of the male's mouth against an object*. 

***Q: Mathematically define 'bite rate' (how would you calculate it?).***

[^intro-stickleback]: For example, see the landing page for 'innate behavior' from [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/ecology-ap/responses-to-the-environment/a/innate-behaviors). However, note that the reference for this result is a textbook, not [the original article](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1938-03659-001). The data from the [publication in German](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01422.x) is not available. Based on replications of the original experiments, it turns out that [Tinbergen's results from the 1937 paper may be less clear](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534445#metadata_info_tab_contents). 

***Q: Would a male stickleback fish's bite rate be higher in the presence of another male or another female?***

We can think of action-specific energy as *internal drive* or *motivation* for a particular behavior (FAP). External stimuli contribute to this motivation. As an analogy, think of eating behavior. The liklihood that you will eat a food can depend on the properties of the food itself. 

***Q: Fill in the following graph according to your food preferences.***

Relationship between variation in food taste and desire to eat food. 
:::

The *strength* of a stimulus is defined in terms of how much it changes the action specific potential for an FAP. 

***Q: Given your preferences, would a sweet food be a strong or weak stimulus for eating?***

***Q: If you are really really really hungry, would you be more or less likely to eat in response to a weak food stimulus compared to when you are full?***

***Q: Think (and refer) back to the experiment on stickleback fish aggression that you analyzed. Which stimulus was the strongest for aggression? Which stimulus was the weakest? What evidence do you have to support your answers?***

***Q: Complete this sentence by selecting one of the options: The more motivated an animal is toward a specific FAP, the ( higher / lower ) the action specific potential for that FAP.***

***Q: Complete this sentence by selecting one of the options: The more motivated an animal is toward a specific FAP, the ( stronger / weaker ) the stimulus needs to be to elicit the FAP.***

The *stimulus threshold* for behavior is defined as the minimum stimulus strength needed to trigger/evoke the behavior.

How does breeding condition effect the stimulus threshold for eliciting a behavior? etc...)***

## Complexities of behavior

:::{admonition} Why?
At each moment in time, only one behavior can occur. Therefore, each possible behavior is competing with all other behaviors. To complicate our analysis, behaviors happen over time. And different behaviors occur over different durations/timescales.
:::

***Q: In the case of complex FAPs involving a series of different movements, how do you think we can decide whether we are dealing with a single FAP or a series of different ones?***

Lorenz names several other complexities that make it difficult to understand the motivation of an animal based on its behavior and even to understand the behavior itself. Ritualization, superposition, and learning are examples of behavioral phenomena that make it hard to determine the set of behaviors that an animal can do and determine the motivation of an animal. 

***Q: With your group, review, compare, and synthesize your understanding of: 'ritualization, superposition, and learning' from your reading.***

### Ritualization

***Q: Create your group's summary of ritualization.***

### Superpositions

***Q: Create your group's summary of superposition.***

***Q: How is the issue of 'superposition' of behavior different from or similar to the issue of 'hierarchy' of behavior?***

### Learning

***Q: How could behavioral learning make it difficult to categorize/define an animal's behavior?***
