## Fundamental units of behavior and their expression

:::{admonition} Why?
In order to study animal behavior as a scientific community, we need to categorize and define an animal behavior in an objective way. The ways in which we define behavior for a particular study must be at an appropriate organizational level and an appropriate timescale for our level of analysis and our question (ultimate versus proximate, neural versus genetic, etc).

### Fundamental units of ...

All living organisms are made up of cells. 

***Q: How many different types of cells can you think of?***

***Q: Organize the following terms according to levels of composition: cells, organs, bodies, organ systems and tissues.***

Cells are considered the *fundamental unit* of life. You can use this model from biology to explore the analagous concept in the study of animal behavior.

***Q: How many levels of organization would you split behavior into? Create a name for, and describe, each level. It can help to think of an animal and some of its behavior to use as an example of your categorization and organization.***

***Q: In your model, what are the fundamental units of behavior? Provide some examples.***

***Q: What timescale do you think that fundamental units of behavior generally occur over?***

***Q: What is the longest timescale that you can think of for something that you would define as an animal behavior?***

### Movemes, Actions, Activities

The *levels of organization* that you explored in the last sections are an example of *hierarchy*. The hierarchical nature of behavior is clear, despite a lack of concensus for terminology used to describe its component parts[^AndersonPerona2014][^Datta2019].

[^AndersonPerona2014]: David J.Anderson and Pietro Perona [Toward a Science of Computational Ethology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.005). Neuron 84:1 (2014).

[^Datta2019]: Datta SR, Anderson DJ, Branson K, Perona P, Leifer A [Computational Neuroethology: A Call to Action](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.09.038). Neuron 104:11-24 (2019). 

***Q: What does 'hierarchy' mean?***

The following language defined by Anderson and Perona[^AndersonPerona2014] provides a reasonable basis for discussion. 

:::{glossary}

Moveme  
	The simplest meaningful pattern associated with a behavior. Typically involves a short, ballistic trajectory described by a verb, such as a turn, a step, or a wing extension, which cannot be further decomposed. It is analogous to a “phoneme” in language.

Action  
	A combination of movemes that always occurs in the same stereotypical sequence and that is also described by a verb. Examples of actions include “walk” (step + step + step), thigmotaxis (walk + turn + walk), etc. In language, it would be analogous to a word or to an idiomatic expression.

Activity  
	A species-characteristic concatenation of actions and movemes whose structure is typical, ranging from stereotyped to variable. Variability can be observed both in the structure or dynamics of the individual actions that comprise an activity, as well as in the timing and/or sequence of the actions. Examples of activities include nest-building, parenting, etc.

The following figure presents these concepts in the context of several issues that we need to grapple with in the study of animal behavior.

A characteristic sequence of behaviors exhibited by a mouse in its home cage as it moves around the walls (thigmotaxis), approaches some food, eats, and then sleeps (center, mouse cartoons). Several key challenges facing any segmentation of continuous behavior into components are illustrated. Behaviors need to be labeled, which raises the problem of ‘‘lumping’’ versus ‘‘splitting’’ (red); for example, mice engage in thigmotaxis, behaviors in which the mouse exhibits locomotion and turning behaviors that are deterministically sequenced to generate an action where the animal circumnavigates its cage. Is thigmotaxis a singular or unitary behavior (because its elements are deterministically linked during its expression), or it is a sequence of walking, turning, and walking behaviors? Should behavior be considered at a single timescale that serially progresses or instead considered a hierarchical process organized at multiple timescales simultaneously (blue)? When the mouse is sniffing and running at the same time, is that a compositional behavior whose basis set includes ‘‘run’’ and ‘‘sniff,’’ or is ‘‘running+sniffing’’ a fundamentally new behavior (purple)?[^Datta2019]
:::

***Q: Pick an animal that you are familiar with (do not spend too much time deliberating over which animal to use). Make an example behavior hierarchy for that animal that spans the activity to moveme levels (do not include all behavior of the animal, just enough to make an example hierarchy of behavior). Think about effective ways to present a hierarchy in developing your response. Include definitions of each component of its behavior that you include. (Do not use any of the examples already given in the figure text).***

### Fixed Action Pattern (FAP)[^instinctive-motor-pattern][^fap], Releasing Mechanisms, and Sign Stimuli

[^instinctive-motor-pattern]: In *Here am I. Where are You?* (1988), Lorenz uses the term 'instinctive motor pattern' instead.

[^fap]: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_action_pattern)

:::{index} fixed action patterns
:::

Female geese sit on their eggs in the nest to incubate them. Sometimes, the eggs roll out of the nest. The goose, noticing an egg outside of the nest, performs an 'egg rolling' behavior in response. As a class, let's watch these two videos of egg rolling:
- [egg rolling video 1](https://youtu.be/7PcteKRA3zs)
- [egg rolling video 2](https://youtu.be/vUNZv-ByPkU)

Because the goose's egg rolling behavior is *stereotyped*, you can define it. Behaviors like these are often categorized as *fixed action patterns* (FAP).

***Q: Define the goose 'egg rolling' behavior 'objectively'.***

***Q: What do you think the function of egg rolling behavior is?***

***Q: What else do you notice in these example videos of egg rolling behavior? List comments and questions that you have.***


:::{index} sign stimuli
:::

One of the standard examples of FAPs given in introductory animal behavior courses, is territorial aggression in stickleback fish[^intro-stickleback]. During the breeding season, the male fish select a territory on which they build a nest. When a male stickleback spots another nearby male in his nesting territory, he will launch into a FAP involving aggressive displays designed to scare off the stranger. However, males are not aggressive to nearby females in their territory. A *bite* is contact of the male's mouth against the object. *Bite rate* can be used to quantify aggression.

[^intro-stickleback]: For example, see the landing page for 'innate behavior' from [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/ecology-ap/responses-to-the-environment/a/innate-behaviors). However, note that the reference for this result is a textbook, not [the original article](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1938-03659-001). The data from the [publication in German](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01422.x) is not available. Based on replications of the original experiments, it turns out that [Tinbergen's results from the 1937 paper may be less clear](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534445#metadata_info_tab_contents). 

***Q: Would a male stickleback fish's bite rate be higher in the presence of another male or another female?***

As a class, we will watch this [video of an experiment on stickleback aggression](https://youtu.be/ZfcGZCGdGVE). As you watch, take your own individual notes on what is happening throughout. 

***Q: What was being tested by the experiment shown in the video?***

***Q: Briefly describe the experimental design behind what was shown in the video.***

***Q: What mathematical equation would you use to calculate 'bite rate'?***

***Q: Based on the video, make a graph of bite rate versus stimulus.***

***Q: Based on the data in your graph, describe the relationship between at least two features of the stimuli and aggressiveness in male stickleback fish.***

***Q: Based on the statement that 'red coloration is a sign stimulus for stickleback aggression FAPs', define 'sign stimulus' generally.***

***Q: Based on your observations of the experiment, what are some issues with the statement that 'red coloration is a sign stimulus for stickleback aggression FAPs'?***

### Action-Specific Potential (ASP; Energy)

:::{index} action specific potential
:::

***Q: Define 'spontaneous.'***

***Q: Define 'appetitive.'***


Graph how ASP changes over time for a behavior
How does the presence of a sign stimulus change the ASP
what happens to ASP once it reaches threshold?
how is the stimulus strength needed to elicit related to the internal drive and behavioral threshold?

In studying animal behavior, we understand an animal's motivation by examining its behavior.

***Q: Based on this process, how would you define motivation?***

## Complexities of behavior

***Q: In the case of complex FAPs involving a series of different movements, how do you think we can decide whether we are dealing with a single FAP or a series of different ones?***

### Ritualization

The evolution of new behaviors for old motivations

### Superpositions

Source of error for determining the motivation of an animal. 

***Q: How is the issue of 'superposition' of behavior different from or similar to the issue of 'hierarchy' of behavior?***

### Learning

Imprinting 
Associative
Operant


### Exploitation

FAPs are stereotyped, which also means that they are predictable. As you know from experiments that test for sign stimuli of FAPs, if a sign stimulus is effectively mimicked, then the FAP will be released as if the natural sign stimulus was encountered. This *sign stimulus : FAP* pair can be thought of as a code. *Code breaking* describes inappropriate release of an FAP by another animal. 

This parasite aggregates and elicits mating behavior from the bee. The parasite can then hitch a ride on the bee back to the hive. 

***Q: What is the FAP in this scenario?***

***Q: What do you think the sign stimulus could be? Name at least two potential alternatives.***

***Q: What testable predictions could you come up with for those alternative hypotheses?***

***Q: What experiment would enable you to distinguish between your alternative hypotheses?***
