# Levels of Analysis

1. [Phylogeny](../levels-of-analysis/phylogeny.md)
2. [Evolutionary (Adaptive Selection)](../levels-of-analysis/adaptation.md)
3. [Neural, Hormonal, and Genetic (essential building blocks)](../levels-of-analysis/neural-hormonal-genetic.md)
4. [Developmental (learning, flexibility, and seasonality)](../levels-of-analysis/development.md)

First, we will go through the foundational components of each level of analysis. 
Then, you will gain practice with each of these levels of analysis through selected examples of animal behavior literature.
