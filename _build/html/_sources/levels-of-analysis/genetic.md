## Proteins

The proteins comprising an animal's body are essential material to all behavioral phenotypes. Proteins provide the physical form of an animal, which grants unique affordances to different animals. Proteins also dictate the functional properties of an animal's nervous system, which orchestrates the actions of behavior directly.

An example protein - the acetylcholine receptor. This protein is found in muscle cells and is necessary for muscle contraction in response to synaptic input from motor neurons. When acetylcholine binds to the receptor, the receptor lets specific ions through the membrane. Top: side view with cell membrane in gray. Bottom: top view with acetylcholine binding sites in red.

## Genetics differences

The *genome* comprises the entire DNA sequence (all genetic material) of an animal.

***Q: Do all somatic cells (cells of the body tissues) have the same genome? Explain your reasoning.***

***Q: Do all somatic cells have the same protein composition? Explain your reasoning.***

Different species exhibit different mating behavior. For example, monogamy and promiscuity are two different behavioral *phenotypes* for mating behavior. 

:::{glossary}

monogamy
 one reproductive partner 

promiscuity
 several reproductive partners at a time

::: 

Because the genome of an animal dictates its bodily material (including their nervous system), it can determine an animal's behavior. 

***Q: In general, would you predict that different behavioral phenotypes are a result of different genes for different phenotypes or a result of sequence variation of the same gene?***

Thomas Insel, head of the National Institute of Mental Health and a pioneer in vole studies, describes voles as "an extraordinary gift to science" in which nature has performed an experiment with which we can ask the question: "what was modified genetically in the brain to get this difference in behavior?"
Voles (one family of the rodent order), have been model system in which the genetics of mating behavior has been extensively investigated. Unlike most rodents, many voles are monogamous, forming bonds that last long after mating (often for life) and cohabitating more or less permanently in subterranean dens. Prarie voles are one of these robustly monogamous species. Interestingly, prairie voles have near-identical cousins called montane voles that do not form social bonds after mating. 

The results of one of the first genetic experiments in montane and prarie voles are shown in Fig. ____.

"Structure of the Vasopressin-receptor (V1a-R) gene in voles. V1a-R genes from
montane vole (M. mon) and prairie vole (M. och) were isolated from genomic DNA

the prairie vole gene. The boxed area within these sites represents the coding
region and the vertical bars in the coding region represent the location of the receptor's
transmembrane domains. The sequences of the genomic clones have been deposited in GenBank

[^Young1999]: Young, L., Nilsen, R., Waymire, K. et al. [Increased affiliative response to vasopressin in mice expressing the V1a receptor from a monogamous vole](https://doi.org/10.1038/23475). Nature 400, 766â€“768 (1999). 

Young et al 1999 [^Young1999] did not find differences in the protein sequence of the V1a receptor gene. Instead, they found differences in the "microsatellite repeats" in the region of the genome read before the gene itself gets read. Although the V1a-R protein iteself is nearly identical between these two species, the protein ends up located in different parts of the brain. Microsatellite repeats do not effect the structure of a protein, but rather regulate where and when it is expressed (transcription and translation).  

## *EPI*genetics.

In order to be transcribed and translated, DNA must be accessible to various proteins. DNA accessibility is tightly controlled by molecular tags on the DNA itself and on histone proteins around which it winds. Critically, these tags are flexibly bound to DNA and histone - tags bind or unbind in response to signals from the environment.

Epigenetic mechanisms involved in regulation of gene expression. Cytosine residues within DNA can be methylated, and lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins can be modified.

"(A) Schematic of epigenetic modifications. Strands of DNA are wrapped around histone octamers, forming nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are organized into chromatin, the building block of a chromosome. Reversible and site-specific histone modifications occur at multiple sites through acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation. DNA methylation occurs at 5-position of cytosine residues in a reaction catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Together, these modifications provide a unique epigenetic signature that regulates chromatin organization and gene expression. (B) Schematic of the reversible changes in chromatin organization that influence gene expression: genes are expressed (switched on) when the chromatin is open (active), and they are inactivated (switched off) when the chromatin is condensed (silent). These dynamic chromatin states are controlled by reversible epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications. White circles = unmethylated cytosines; red circles = methylated cytosines."[^Rodenhiser-Mann]

## Heritability and Variability

***Q: Do you think methylation patterns are heritable (passed on across generations)? Why (not)?***

An animal's behavior is comprised of many phenotypes. For example, one person might: participate in a lot of sports, spend a lot of their time socializing with other people, and read a lot; while another person might: not do any sports, spend most of their time alone, and write a lot. Let's consider that these two people mated. If all of their offspring were either "just like one parent" or "just like the other parent", then it might infer that the genes underlying all three of these behaviors are *linked*. 

In sexual reproduction, gametes are produced from the genome of a parent. Genes on separate chromosomes *assort independently* because of the random orientation of homologous chromosome pairs during meiosis.

The homologues of each pair separate in the first stage of meiosis. In this process, which side the male parent and female parent chromosomes of each pair go to is random. When we are following two genes, this results in four types of gametes that are produced with equal frequency.
