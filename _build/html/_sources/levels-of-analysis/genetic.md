## Genetics Primer

### Proteins

The proteins comprising an animal's body are essential material to all behavioral phenotypes. Proteins provide the physical form of an animal, which grants unique affordances to different animals. Proteins also dictate the functional properties of an animal's nervous system, which orchestrates the actions of behavior directly.

## Experimental Approaches

### Genes?

**Case Study: Burrowing Behavior**

You have already examined [the phylogeny of burrowing behavior among *Peromyscus*](phylogeny-burrowing-assignment). Are burrowing behavior phenotypes inherited genetically or learned culturally? Research using *P. maniculatus* and *P. polionotus* provide a great example of how to investigate this question.

cross-fostering

### What Genes? 

#### Forward Genetics

The identification of genomic regions associated with behavioral phenotypes is a first step in the identification of causal genes responsible for variation in a naturally evolved, complex behavior. 

Gregor Mendel was either clever or lucky enough to study traits of simple inheritance in his pea plants; however, many plant characters of interest to modern geneticists are complex (*quantitative*). Understanding the genetic basis of quantitative traits requires a combination of modern molecular genetic techniques and powerful statistical methods.

**Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping** is a widely used statistical tool for this purpose. QTL mapping simply involves finding an association between a genetic marker and a phenotype that can be measured.

:::{figure-md} QTL-mapping-plants
:class: figure

<img src="/images/QTL-mapping-plants.png" alt="fishy" width="400px">

In QTL mapping, the parental alleles are shuffled by *crossing* parents and progeny in various orders to create a large mapping population.[^Mauricio-2001] 
:::

[^Mauricio-2001]: Figure from [Mauricio, R. Mapping quantitative trait loci in plants: uses and caveats for evolutionary biology. Nat Rev Genet 2, 370–381 (2001).](https://doi.org/10.1038/35072085)

:::{figure-md} QTL-mapping-plants-regression
:class: figure

<img src="/images/QTL-mapping-plants-regression.png" alt="fishy" width="400px">

The phenotype and the multilocus genotype of each individual in the mapping population are measured. *Markers* along the genome that are specific to each parental genotype are targetted for analysis. There are several different statistical techniques available for QTL mapping. Essentially, it is a regression or correlation.[^Mauricio-2001]  
:::

Several features of Peromyscus burrowing behavior make it a well-suited system for tackling how genetic change leads to complex behavioral change. 
- Burrowing behavior is largely innate.
- A burrow is a behavioral product (“extended phenotype”) that can be measured like a morphological trait. 

To localize the causal regions for burrowing behavior in the genome, hybrid animals from a large cross were assayed for burrowing behavior and then genotyped. Then estimated the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by each QTL.

Linkage group 5 contains a single QTL associated with escape-tunnel presence (red line). Dotted line represents log odds ratio (lod) significance threshold (genome-wide α = 0.05, lod = ∼3.0). 1.5-lod confidence intervals and scale in centimorgans (cM) are shown in light blue.

**Genetic Sequencing** is then a necessary (and difficult) step to understand how specific sequence changes cause behavioral changes. 

#### Heritability Patterns

It was previously generally thought that animal behaviors are too complex to be immediately determined by genetic factors. For example, male courtship behavior in Drosophila is a stereotyped sequence of FAPs in which a male follows a female, taps the female, sings a song by vibrating one wing, licks the female’s genitalia and curls the abdomen to attempt copulation. Male courtship behavior is obviously complex, hwowever, it was one of the first behaviors found to be specified by a single gene[^fruitless-dickson]. Male homozygous fruitless mutants have normal genitalia but do not exhibit courtship behavior toward female flies. 

[^fruitless-dickson]: [Ebru Demir and Barry J. Dickson (2005) fruitless Splicing Specifies Male Courtship Behavior in Drosophila. Cell 121(5)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.027)

However, many behaviors are *polygenic*. 

*Heritability patterns* are a useful tool for inferring the number of and relationship among genes contributing to complex behavioral phenotyps. 

Burrowing behavior and parental care behavior have both diverged significantly between two interfertile sister species, P. maniculatus and P. polionotus., for which forward genetic approaches combined with high-throughput genotyping in Peromyscus have been successful in identifying the genetic architecture of complex behavior. 

Example: data distributions from bendesky 2017

Example: compare correlation of behavioral phenotype features from burrowing with parental care
Tunnel lengths and the presence of escape tunnels (that is, tunnel number) are only weakly correlated in BC mice[^Weber-2013]. Therefore, the complex burrows of P. polionotus comprise at least two separate behavioural modules, one for tunnel length and one for the presence of an escape tunnel.

#### Reverse Genetics

## Case Study: Behavioral differences through genetic differences

Because the genome of an animal dictates its bodily material (including their nervous system), it can determine an animal's behavior. Many people specialize in researching the genetic differences among species and individuals that explain behavioral differences. For example, Thomas Insel studies the genetic basis of mating behavior.

Monogamy and promiscuity are two common *phenotypes* for mating behavior. 

:::{glossary}

monogamy
 one reproductive partner 

promiscuity
 several reproductive partners at a time

::: 

Thomas Insel, head of the National Institute of Mental Health and a pioneer in vole studies, describes voles as "an extraordinary gift to science" in which nature has performed an experiment with which we can ask the question: "what was modified genetically in the brain to get this difference in behavior?" In this case, mating behavior.
Unlike most rodents, many voles are monogamous, forming bonds that last long after mating (often for life) and cohabitating more or less permanently in subterranean dens. Prarie voles are one of these robustly monogamous species. Interestingly, prairie voles have near-identical cousins called montane voles that do not form social bonds after mating. 

The results of one of the first genetic experiments in montane and prarie voles are shown in Fig. ____.

the prairie vole gene. The boxed area within these sites represents the coding
region and the vertical bars in the coding region represent the location of the receptor's
transmembrane domains. The sequences of the genomic clones have been deposited in GenBank

:::

[^Young1999]: Young, L., Nilsen, R., Waymire, K. et al. [Increased affiliative response to vasopressin in mice expressing the V1a receptor from a monogamous vole](https://doi.org/10.1038/23475). Nature 400, 766–768 (1999). 

Young et al 1999 [^Young1999] did not find differences in the protein sequence of the V1a receptor gene. Instead, they found differences in the "microsatellite repeats" in the region of the genome read before the gene itself gets read. Although the V1a-R protein iteself is nearly identical between these two species, the protein ends up located in different parts of the brain. Microsatellite repeats do not effect the structure of a protein, but rather regulate where and when it is expressed (transcribed and translated).  


## Case Study: Inheritance of complex behavioral syndromes

An animal's behavior is comprised of many phenotypes. For example, one person might: participate in a lot of sports, spend a lot of their time socializing with other people, and read a lot; while another person might: not do any sports, spend most of their time alone, and write a lot. Let's consider that these two people mated. If all of their offspring were either "just like one parent" or "just like the other parent", then it might infer that the genes underlying all three of these behaviors are *linked*. 

In sexual reproduction, gametes are produced from the genome of a parent. Genes on separate chromosomes *assort independently* because of the random orientation of homologous chromosome pairs during meiosis. 

:::{figure-md} Making-Gametes-KhanAcademy
:class: figure

<img src="/images/Making-Gametes-KhanAcademy.png" alt="fishy" width="500px">

The homologues of each pair separate in the first stage of meiosis. In this process, which side the male parent and female parent chromosomes of each pair go to is random. When we are following two genes, this results in four types of gametes that are produced with equal frequency.
