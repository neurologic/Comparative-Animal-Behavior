# Development


Developmental environments influence behavior (current and future). 

Why does an animal behave the way it does? Maybe because of conditions it encountered during development. 

## Imprinting

## Maternal stress

## Polyphenisms



The environment can modulate development, generating sources of phenotypic variation. And events that happen during development can effect an animal's fitness as an adult. Early life conditions can have positive, negative, or no effects on behavioral development and fitness, either current or future, depending on the species and environment in which it lives.
