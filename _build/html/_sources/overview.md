# Overview

## Observation of Behavior (Ethogram)

[Ethogram of operating room behavior.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs12160-016-9773-0)

## Behavioral Diversity

:::{note}
difference between "actions" and behavior when think about many behaviors (that are often comprised of sets of actions occurring over longer timescales).
:::

Can I get a list of "all behaviors" from the literature?

### Behavioral Style

- Social/Solitary
- Continuous/Cyclic

### Complex Behavior Patterns

- Obtaining calories
- Mating and Bonding
- Competing
- Defense
- Caring for offspring
- Communication
- Hibernating/Migrating


### Skills needed

- Navigation

## Levels of Analysis (Tinbergen)

1. Phylogeny
2. Evolutionary (Adaptive Selection)
3. Neural and Genetic (essential building blocks)
4. Hormonal and Developmental (flexibility, modulation, seasonality, etc)</li>

## Understanding Behavior

> Working through select examples from behavioral diversity to practice thinking about all levels of explanation for behavior in a comparative approach. Examples of techniques implemented in Animal Behavior studies at all levels. 


### Scales of sociality.
- Solitary
- Cooperation
- Eusociality
