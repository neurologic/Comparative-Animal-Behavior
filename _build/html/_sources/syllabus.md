# Syllabus 

Being able to generate correct answers is important, but it is not more important than being
able to explain how to arrive at those answers.


Classroom session structure:
1. Students are expected to work collaboratively, generally in groups of three or four.
2. The students work on the activity during class time with a facilitator present.
3.  The dominant mode of instruction is not lecture or instructor-centered; the instructor
serves predominantly as a facilitator of student learning.
4. Students have assigned (rotating) roles within their groups.
5. The activities are designed to be the first introduction to the topic or specific content. You won't necessarily "know the answer" before you start. 
6. Groups are expected to complete all of the Questions during class. There may be additional exercises or problems expected to be completed outside of class.

Students are
expected to reinforce what they have learned after the concepts have been introduced in class.
This reinforcement includes reading from relevant portions of an appropriate textbook. In
addition, students should work through problems and exercises to reinforce the key ideas
from class and as practice for solving questions for exams. In the author’s classroom, students
also prepare for a short, one-question, five-minute quiz taken individually at the beginning of
every class meeting. The quiz question addresses one of the fundamental concepts that was
developed in the previous class and provides feedback to each student (and to the instructor)
concerning the extent to which this important material has been mastered. 

Although content mastery is important in all STEM disciplines, the vast majority of students
in STEM classes at the post-secondary levels (especially at the introductory
level) are unlikely to be regularly applying most (if any) of the specific content knowledge
they are expected to master outside of the course—with the possible exception of using some
of the content in sequent courses. This is not to diminish the importance of this content, but
rather to emphasize that the development of other skills—particularly thinking, learning,
communication, and interpersonal skills—are likely to be much more useful and transferable
over the course of an individual’s lifetime.


"Process Skills":
- Communication
- Assessment, particularly self-assessment
- Teamwork
- Management
- Information Processing
- Critical Thinking
- Problem Solving

A problem exists when one does not know what to do or does not have an internalized
algorithm for obtaining an answer. If one knows what to do, it’s not a problem—it is an
exercise. Many STEM textbooks have numerous numbered items at the end of each chapter
for students to solve; regardless of how these are labeled, in most cases the vast majority of
these items are exercises, not problems. That is, students in general know what to do when
they encounter these items: they either have an internalized algorithm for generating a
correct answer, or they know that what they need to do to generate a correct answer is to look
back through the chapter for a sample item that is phrased similarly and then mimic the
solution that is presented there.

—for many,
many people—when assessment feedback and evaluative feedback are provided
simultaneously, the recipient focuses on the evaluation and ignores (or mostly ignores) the
assessment. The implication for instruction is that if we want our students to improve at
something, we need to provide assessment feedback that is independent of evaluative
feedback. This desire to separate assessment from evaluation is the reason that, in many
POGIL classrooms, the POGIL activity is not graded. (Some instructors assign some “points”
for completeness, but in general, students are not evaluated on the “correctness” of the
responses that they provide.) The purpose of the activity is to enable students to develop
concepts and deepen their understanding of those concepts. Interactions among students and
between students and the instructor are intentionally assessment-oriented. Making this shift
in thinking to the idea that an important role for the instructor is to provide assessment
opportunities for students in the classroom can bring about a paradigm shift in what takes
place in the classroom and for what purpose.

More than eighty percent
of employers surveyed indicated that undergraduate education should place more emphasis
on the following three areas, all of which are targeted process skills in a POGIL learning
environment:
•Critical thinking and analytical reasoning
•Complex problem solving and analysis
•Written and oral communication

> Note, not content knowledge

For group in-class work, specific roles are:
- timekeeper and secretary
- group advocate/communication
- group mediator

Final Project:
Create a media project (written, audio, video, etc) that summarizes the current scientific understanding of a specific animal behavior. These summaries include information relating to each of the four areas of animal behavior as outlined by Tinbergen (1963). Because some model organisms are more suited to specific types of research, some sites incorporate research from multiple organisms in order to discuss the ontogeny, mechanism, phylogeny and adaptive value of the specific animal behavior. Books, websites, and newspapers were used, but the majority of the information presented here is supported by primary literature.


Bronowski wrote in his 1951 book The Commonsense of Science: "It has been one of the most destructive modern prejudices that art and science are different and somehow incompatible interests".

It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known but to question it
