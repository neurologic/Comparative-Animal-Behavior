## Background and Introduction  

As an introduction to the study of animal behavior, this course will examine the factors that control the behavior of vertebrates and invertebrates within evolutionary, and physiological contexts. All animals face similar challenges and we will examine the common, and sometimes unique, behavioral strategies used to meet these challenges. This kind of comparative approach is paramount to ethology, which is the scientific study of animal behavior. Animal behavior is the main subject of this course, and the overarching goal is learning what it means to understand animal behavior through the scientific method. To achieve this goal, you will practice synthesizing knowledge and approaches from diverse fields of science that you have already encountered in your studies: genetics, evolutionary biology and ecology, developmental biology, neuroscience, molecular biology, and psychology (to name a few). 

This class is about more than Animal Behavior as a topic itself. Although content mastery is important, the vast majority of students in STEM classes at the University level (especially in Introductory classes where breadth is a feature of the curriculum) are unlikely to be regularly applying most (if any) of the specific content knowledge outside of the course (with the possible exception of using some of the content in sequent courses). This is not to diminish the importance of this content, but rather to emphasize that the development of ones interests and the development of other skills (particularly thinking, learning, communication, and interpersonal skills) are likely to be just as useful and transferable over the course of an individual’s lifetime. 

Of you I ask:
- Respect to yourself and others in the class.
- Independence and self-motivation. This is your education. The learning process belongs to you.
- Willingness to push yourself to learn as much as you can about the topics and concepts that we will examine.

We’ll be working together to create an equitable and inclusive environment of mutual respect, in which we all feel comfortable to share our moments of confusion, ask questions, and challenge our understanding. Everyone should be able to succeed in this course. If you do not feel that is the case please let me know.

It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin[^ragamuffin], barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known but to question it

-—  Jacob Bronowski, The Ascent of Man
:::

[^ragamuffin]: Oxford languages defines it as: "*a person, typically a child, in ragged, dirty clothes*". It is also a breed of cat. The term ragamuffin is used affectionately in this context of recognizing the value of rugged scrappiness. Though its roots are in describing a lazy and worthless, or beggarly individual. In the early 19th century the word became associated with the children who would dress up for Thanksgiving as ragamuffins and parade asking for handouts, parodying begging and beggars. I have not found any resources informing that this word is derogatory or discriminatory nor contains any racial undertones. If you are informed otherwise do not hesitate to edit this quote for the syllabus. 

Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.

## Classroom Sessions
1. Students are expected to work collaboratively, generally in groups of three or four.
2. The students work on the activity during class time with a facilitator present.
3. The dominant mode of instruction is not lecture or instructor-centered; the instructor serves predominantly as a facilitator of student learning.
4. Students have assigned (rotating) roles within their groups.
5. The activities are designed to be the first introduction to the topic or specific content. You won't necessarily "know the answer" before you start. 
6. Groups are expected to complete all of the Questions during class. There may be additional exercises or problems expected to be completed outside of class.

For group in-class work, specific roles are:[^roles-details]
- recorder
- liason
- facilitator
- strategy analyst

**Class Preparation**  
In preparation for class, complete any "Assignments" listed in the [Schedule](../schedule) page. Sometimes this will include producing work that you bring to the corresponding classroom session, other times it will just include readings. Readings are meant to reinforce the concepts that are introduced (either before or after) through classroom activities and discussion.

## Grading
All graded work will be handed in via Gradescope.

:::

**<font color="green">Weekly In-Class Work</font>** *20%*  
Due each Friday by midnight. Each week the group secretary (a rotating role) will be responsible for handing in the work that your group did in class (this can include allocating the responsibility if necessary). The purpose of the in-class work is to enable you to develop concepts and deepen your understanding of those concepts. Interactions among students and between students and the instructor are intentionally assessment-oriented (not *evaluative*). This work will be graded either **0:missing**, **1:incomplete**, **2:complete *but***, or **3:complete**. Your final score at the end of the semester will reflect a cummulative sum of your scores on each submission. Added to this score will be CR/U for any in-class assessments. 

**<font color="orange">Cummulative Exam</font>** *60%*  
[Due (approximately) every other week by Monday at midnight](../assessment-sum/cummulative-exam). Instead of one or two big exams, you will have smaller bi-weekly (approximately) assignments. The points you earn on each of these assignments will be tallied toward your total exam score for the semester. The due dates may be subject to change if there are major shifts in the daily schedule due to the differing needs of each particular class as they move through the material. The due dates are listed in the Cummulative Exam tab

**<font color="purple">Capstone</font>** *20%*  
Due by midnight on the first day of final exams (). Your work throughout the semester builds toward your Capstone assignment.  

***Attendence*** in classroom sessions is mandatory. If unforseeable emergency comes up, please reach out as soon as possible so that we can make a plan.  


## Other

**Email Policy**  
I do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours. However, I cannot guarantee email communication over the weekend as this time is reserved for family.

**Deadlines**
Assignment due dates are available from the start of the semester. Students are expected to meet all deadlines. Extracurricular activities (sports, social/volunteer activities) and other academic commitments are unacceptable excuses for rescheduling requests. Rescheduling a test will only be considered in unforeseen and extreme circumstances. 

**Time Commitment**  
Attendence in classroom sessions is mandatory. If your in-class work is finished before the classroom session ends, you can use the additional time to work on Take Home work or explore the preparation further. I have designed the class so that it should be feasible to satisfactorily complete the requirements with approximately twelve hours per week of time commitment (as per the standards for a full credit course). If you are spending more time than this on a regular basis I encourage you to check in with me.


**Accommodation Statement**  
Wesleyan University is committed to ensuring that all qualified students with disabilities are afforded an equal opportunity to participate in, and benefit from, its programs and services.

Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). The Office of Student Affairs has more information.
 
I remind students of [the Wesleyan honor code](http://www.wesleyan.edu/studentaffairs/honorboard/honorcode.html) which you signed as a first-year student. I value your academic integrity and therefore require that you sign the following summary pledge: ***In accordance with the Honor Code, I affirm that all work for this course expresses my own contributions (including in collaboration with others) and all content taken from other sources has been properly acknowledged. I affirm that all work is completed without improper assistance.***
 
For written and multimedia work: In accordance with the Honor Code, I affirm that this work is my own and all content taken from other sources has been properly acknowledged
 
It is expressly forbidden to submit work from another course without my permission. While written reports will be accepted, they must be accompanied by an electronic format too. Submitting only in electronic format is acceptable. Please note that active checking for plagiarism will occur. Ensure that all sources are cited and in sufficient detail for the reader to locate your primary source. Consult with me if you are uncertain whether a source needs citing. Don’t risk plagiarism as this is an academic violation with severe consequences. Should I suspect the honor code has been violated, I will consult the Vice President for Student Affairs to decide whether to refer the matter to the Honor Board.


**Skills beyond content** 
More than eighty percent of employers surveyed indicated that undergraduate education should place more emphasis
on the following three areas, all of which are targeted process skills in a POGIL learning
environment:
•Critical thinking and analytical reasoning
•Complex problem solving and analysis
•Written and oral communication

"Process Skills":
- Communication
- Assessment, particularly self-assessment
- Teamwork
- Management
- Information Processing
- Critical Thinking
- Problem Solving

**Problems versus Exercises**
A problem exists when one does not know what to do or does not have an internalized
algorithm for obtaining an answer. If one knows what to do, it’s not a problem—it is an
exercise. Many STEM textbooks have numerous numbered items at the end of each chapter
for students to solve; regardless of how these are labeled, in most cases the vast majority of
these items are exercises, not problems. That is, students in general know what to do when
they encounter these items: they either have an internalized algorithm for generating a
correct answer, or they know that what they need to do to generate a correct answer is to look
back through the chapter for a sample item that is phrased similarly and then mimic the
solution that is presented there.
