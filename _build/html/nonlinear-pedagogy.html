  <p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcpwEoW1uY8">Four basic approaches to teaching and student learning</a> - how it all began with behaviourism, how liberationism frees the mind, how constructivism is all chat, and how connectivism could be the next big thing.</p>
<p>In NLP, teachers should use inquiry as their primary teaching tool. Instructions should be kept short, feedback should be student-led, and tools/knowledge sharing should be related to student inquiry.</p>
<p>Asking questions to direct experimentation and learn about student experience should be the primary form of instruction.</p>
<p>RULE OF THUMB: if you’re a coach, and you’re talking, 80% of the time you should be asking a question.</p>
<p>Students that are accomplishing things that I have never seen before. That can be exciting if you let yourself go into a little bit of an unplanned improvisational place with them. And that can be scary because undermines the teacher’s natural authority in the space.
But <strong>in using this approach we are creating a culture and a system in which the teacher is an organizer not an authority</strong>.
The teacher’s work is to <strong>organize the students’ experience, to time manage, to facilitate interesting problem solving – not to tell everyone how it’s supposed to be done and then make them do it that way</strong>. If your used to being an authority in your space, abdicating that authority can be really scary at first. Don’t try to change everything overnight. Don’t try to go too quickly. INstall these ideas slowly one by one. Stick with what you know at first.</p>
<p>Trying to avoid being ‘custodail’ in my teaching practice: teaching the way I was taught, serving as a ‘custodian’ of a tradition that was passed to us by our teachers and refined by our practice. Instead of staying ‘close to the tree’ and teaching the traditions exactly as I received them, I strive to incorporate, innovate and create new techniqu new teaching methods. Importantly, I do not want to remain custodial of teaching methdos that damage people and acknowledge the mental or physical damage my teachers may have unintentionally done to us, even if we did become great at the skill they were teaching me.</p>
<p>Teaching style has a ‘philosophical underpinning’: a set of assumptions or ideas about how learning takes place in students.</p>
<p>‘Linear’ and ‘Non-linear’ pedagogy (teaching method) are based on two different theories that describe how we learn new skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Most (recent) traditional teaching is based on the ideas that are underneath linear pedagogy
NLP accounts for individual learning differences in a much more robust way.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Linear:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Skill is explained, may be demonstrated, and then attempted
Give feedback to ‘cue’ students towards a theoretical ‘ideal template’
Requires a teacher with knowledge about the ‘ideal template’ and experience cueing students effectively
Underpinned by informational processing theory, which states that we learn skills by absorbing and processing information in stages: first borady, then with growing attention, and with a final stage where the skill becomes automatic
The ideal template might not be adaptable to different ways of thinking or different pre-existing knowledge
the teacher’s pre-existing knowledge and experience drive the learning (a ‘teacher-centric’ approach - the learning experience centers on the teacher’s pre-existing knowledge, and the students’ success is based on their ability to ‘match up’)
Promotes passivity in learning (the student is a passive receptacle of instruction and knowledge)
Because complexity is not introduced (one or few ideal templates), the skill may not transfer between the learning context and other contexts.
variability is seen as noise
executing the skill template is the aim (usually defined by a set of competitive code standards, or by deep traditions in the subject, etc). Grading is based on how close the student comes to “the way to do something”
whether a thought/idea/approach is good or bad is determined by proximity to the template (a consequence of this is that the template is often being seen as related to certain backgrounds or ways of thinking)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Non-Linear:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>‘tasks’ (challenges, goals, or problems) are presented, and no solution or template is explained
students are encouraged to explore, and teachers will alter the task or tasks based on individual or group performance
underpinned by a learning theory called ecological dynamics, which states that we are complex adaptive systems that create knowledge and ideas in response to our environment, our needs, and our capacity. learning is a process of managing the variables of our capacity, task, and the environment.
teachers are designers of the environment-actor-task interactions
teach concepts and applications, not skill templates
dive into rabbit holes. the rabbit holes are the point
incentivise skill/knowledge building through exploration (and keep designs well risk-managed)
requires the active participation of the learner. If the learner is not motivated to participate or is unfamiliar with engaged learning, the approach may falter
risks must be assessed and managed more that linear (where risk assessment is more ‘built in’)
in competitive contexts, an argument could be made that complexity and control (being able to do things many ways intentionally) are unecessary (only doing it one way is ever desirable in the context of the competition so the increased complexity of anything different is wasted time)
variability is seen as valuable
succeeding at the task is the aim (but does not need to be accomplished a certain way)
all thoughts/ideas/approaches are valued in relation to the task at hand – control and success can be emphasized. variability creates a context in which everyone’s way of doing something can be valued. Success is not limited by background or ways of thinking.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>important to foster valuation of critical thinking… whether students feel it is important to rigorously think and create.</p>
<p>NLP may or may not improve technical results. However, the improvements beyond technical results include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>improve creativity and adaptability
improve self-confidence
account for individual learning differences
affect the valuation and motivation associated with the skills</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>‘Task constraints’ - alterning rules or goals of the task to create change. You can alter the environment, the actor, or the rules</p>
<p>‘Positive challenges’ - a task that is challenging, but possible</p>
<p>“Education systems worldwide have recently pursued school reforms with the introduction of novel curriculum content and pedagogical approaches aimed at so-called 21st-century skills (for a review of the frameworks, see Dede, 2009). These skills include critical thinking and problem-solving, collaboration, creativity and innovation. Learning objectives are shifting from the reproduction of taught content to higher level learning. However, this level of reform requires both the teachers and wider school communities to build new capabilities. The teachers themselves need to master these skills, alongside developing effective pedagogical models to teach those skills, whereas schools must become learning organisations for both pupils and teachers alike (Saavedra &amp; Opfer, 2012).”<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#harkki-2021-educational-change" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>“A non-linear pedagogy utilises open-ended learning activities in which the student groups create solutions to ill-defined, authentic and complex problems or design challenges Lahti, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, &amp; Hakkarainen, 2004, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, Viilo, &amp; Hakkarainen, 2010. Such tasks are characterised by emergent goals that are formed and modified collaboratively by students during the course of pursuing them (Scardamalia, Bransford, Kozma, &amp; Quellmalz, 2011). Student groups’ own ideas and questions are intentionally brought into play, and the groups are encouraged to pursue and develop their own interests. Projects often extend the boundaries of school subjects, which makes co-teaching a natural resource.</p>
<p>The emphasis on self-directed learning, experimentation and harnessing failures as learning opportunities yields divergent and unanticipated learning trajectories requiring novel formative assessment practices. Concurrently, knowing how and when to provide tailored guidance and scaffolding is becoming increasingly challenging for teachers. Teachers need to create adaptive structures that provide scaffolding throughout the learning process and facilitate collaboration, yet they also need to flexibly provide on-demand scaffolding in response to each pupil’s unique needs (Riikonen, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, &amp; Hakkarainen, 2018). Sawyer (2011) describes such an adaptive process of teaching and learning as collective improvisation and invention. The improvisation metaphor emphasises how teachers and students are collectively generating epistemic practices and an environment that affords their evolving process of learning and collaboration (Markauskaite &amp; Goodyear, 2016). These circumstances provide novel opportunities for teacher collaboration – the co-construction of 21st-century co-teaching practices.</p>
<p>As such, the above pedagogical principles are not totally new. There has been pioneering work and admirable efforts to bring knowledge creation and inquiry learning to schools (Ching &amp; Kafai, 2008; Kolodner et al., 2003; Paavola, Lipponen, &amp; Hakkarainen, 2004; Zhang, Scardamalia, Reeve, &amp; Messina, 2009). However, this previous research has focused more on student activities and learning than on teaching, with few exceptions, such as (Viilo, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, &amp; Hakkarainen, 2018). “<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#harkki-2021-educational-change" id="id2">1</a></p>
<p>Students in this learning context are often distressed because of the “what should I do” feeling when the “how to” is not a restricted protocol or recipe.
Many students protest about such an explorative way of working and do not see the value in productive failure. As the work proceedes, many students’ frustration turns to enthusiasm as they realize that they are achieving on new levels – novel products that they themselves had planned and made.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#harkki-2021-educational-change" id="id3">1</a></p>
<p>“If we take an ecological dynamics approach to conceptualise PE, we begin to realise that PE in its current format, such as 45–60 min of recursive (year on year) blocks of sports/activities undertaken in the same facilities and environments, will likely lead to diminishing emotional engagement due to a lack of opportunities for exploration, search, discovery, invention and adaptation.” <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17408989.2021.1886271">An ecological dynamics conceptualisation of physical ‘education’: Where we have been and where we could go next</a></p>
