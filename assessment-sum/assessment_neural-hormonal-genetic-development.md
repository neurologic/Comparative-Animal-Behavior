## Section 1

Recently, Todd and colleagues found, in mice, that the diurnal variation in aggression is mediated by a circuit linking SCN to VMHvl. SCN neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) project to subparaventricular zone (SPZ), which in turn send inhibitory projections to VMH89. Since SPZ cells are most active during the beginning of the daytime, they provide the strongest inhibitory control of VMH cells and reduce the level of aggression at that time. Eliminating the GABAergic transmission of the SPZ cells abolished the diurnal variation of aggression propensity.

**Q** (): These results show that the synaptic connection between SCZ and the VMH is [EXCITATORY / INHIBITORY] because the VMH neuron membrane potential [DEPOLARIZES / HYPERPOLARIZES] in response to activation of the SCZ. 

**Q** (): From this data, we can infer that:  
a) SCZ neurotransmitters bind to potassium ion channels.  
b) SCZ neurons synaptically change the potassium conductance in the VMH neurons  
c) that the equilibrium potential of the ion ... must be lower than the membrane potential of the neuron  
d) that the equilibrium potential of the ion ... must be higher than the membrane potential of the neuron

**Q** (): If SCN neuron activity suppresses aggresion, what type of synaptic connection exists between SCN and SCZ? Explain your reasoning. 

**Q4 (2 points; 3 minutes)**: If the membrane potential of VMH neurons is more hyperpolarized, then a stronger stimulus would be needed to depolarize the neuron’s membrane above spike threshold. 
This neural mechanism is analogous to the Lorenz model of behavior because, in the Lorenz model, the stimulus threshold for a FAP _________________.  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below that fills in the blank appropriately.)  
a) is the same as the behavioral threshold  
b) decreases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold  
c) increases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold

**Q5 (2 points; 2 minutes)**: In analogy to the Lorenz model, what term would be the best to use to describe the stimulus strength needed to depolarize a VMH neuron above its voltage spike threshold?  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)  
a) behavioral threshold  
b) stimulus threshold  
c) action specific potential  
d) spontaneous drive


## Section 1: A study of Tetra Behavioral Phenotypes

(*This section should take \~35 min total: \~5-10 minutes of general setup information; \~25 min questions*)

[^oliva-2022]: [Oliva et al (2022) Characterizing the genetic basis of trait evolution in the Mexican cavefish. Evol Dev. 2022 Sep;24(5):131-144.](https://doi.org/10.1111/ede.12412)

The Mexican tetra, *Astyanax mexicanus*, consists of populations of fish that inhabit caves in Northeast Mexico, and populations of surface fish, that inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. Critically, these two independent populations can still breed with each other and produce viable offspring (ie. they are interfertile populations). 

Recently, purebred populations of cave and surface fish were tested for behavioral differences in locomotor activity, escape reflex movement, and prey capture. Each behavior was quantified by two traits. For example, prey capture behavior was quantified by the strike angle and the strike distance (Figure 1). The two populations had different behavioral phenotypes.

**Figure 1**: Cave fish capture prey with a larger strike angle and shorter strike distance than surface fish.

**Q1 (5 points; \~7 minutes)**: **Refer to Figure 1**. ***Describe an experiment*** that would enable you to determine whether prey capture behavior in each of these independent populations (surface and cave fish) is genetically inherited or learned from their parents. ***Summarize in words*** the predicted results under each hypothesis (that the behavior is genetically inherited or learned). For each hypothesis, make a ***plot of the results you would predict*** from your proposed experiment (*just plot the approximate predicted median trait values-no need for the distribution; make sure to label your axes.*).  

---


After quantifying the behavioral traits of cave and surface fish, the researchers performed a genetic cross experiment (Figure 2). The **F2** population was then assessed by the same behavioral metrics that the parental populations were assessed by (Figure 3). The specifics of the behavioral trait metrics are not important, but knowing the names of the metrics will help you interpret Figure 4. *Escape* behavior was quantified by the body's ***peak angle*** during the c-shape phase of the c-start escape and by the ***angular velocity*** from the start of the c-shape to the time the body was at its peak angle. *Prey capture* behavior was quantified by the ***strike angle*** and the ***strike distance***. *Locomotion* behavior was quantified by the ***time in the center*** of the arena and the ***total distance*** moved during the test.

**Q2 (3 points; \~5 minutes)**: *From the results shown in Figure 4*, the researchers could infer that:  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below. Then, ***explain your reasoning***.)   
**a**) The genes for the escape behavior traits are "linked" to the genes for all other behavioral triats tested.    
**b**) The genes for the escape behavior traits are more likely to recombine during chromosome crossover events than the genes for the other traits.  
**c**) The genes for locomotion behavior are likely on different chromosomes than the genes for prey capture behavior.   
**d**) Escape behavior is the only behavior that is significantly genetically inherited.

---

**Q3 (2 points; \~3 minutes)**: ***QTL analysis*** is different from the analysis shown in Figure 4 because:  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)   
**a**) QTL analysis measures the correlation between genes, not behaviors.  
**b**) QTL analysis actually tells you the genotype that codes for each trait.  
**c**) QTL analysis assesses correlations between the genotype of specific chromosomal regions and the behavioral phenotypes rather than correlation between behaviors.

---

**Q4 (3 points; \~7 minutes)**: Which of the two phenotype distributions would you expect in the F2 progeny if ***strike distance*** was a *polygenic* trait (versus a monogenic trait)? ***Choose the one correct option (A or B)***. Then, in 1-3 sentences, explain why.

**Q5 (2 points; \~3 minutes)**: If ***F2 progeny*** were kept in an isolated cave environment and left to breed for many future generations, which of the following outcomes would you predict?  
***This experimental cave population would***:  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below. You can provide a little bit of reasoning for potential partial credit if you wish to explain your logic, but it is not required).   
**a**) eventually evolve the phenotype of the original cave fish parental population because they are under the same selective pressures as the cave fish parental population.  
**b**) maintain a mix between cave and surface fish phenotypes because the phenotypes are genetically inherited rather than learned.  


## Section 2: Nurses and Foragers

(*This section should take \~25 min total: \~5-10 minutes of general setup information; \~25 min questions*)

In honey bees, there are two different behavioral phenotypes among worker bees. The differences in individual phenotype are correlated with differences in age. During the first 2-3 weeks of adult life, workers exhibit the ***nurse*** phenotype and perform several different tasks in the hive, including brood care. After 3 weeks a worker will generally shift to the ***forager*** phenotype and leave the hive in search of nectar and pollen. The shift in behavioral phenotype occurs with a shift in morphological traits as well. 

However, the timing of the transition from nurse to foraging phenotype is variable and depends on the needs of the colony. If there are more foragers than necessary in the colony, then nurses will delay their transition to the foraging phenotype and remain a nurse until they are older ("***old nurse***"). If there are not enough foragers in the colony, then nurses will transition to the foraging phenotype at a younger age ("***young forager***").

**Figure 5**: Gene expression of worker bees at different ages and of different phenotypes (YN = young nurse; OF = old forager; YF = young forager; ON = old nurse). The genes tested label each row. Each column within each experimental condition is a different bee whose gene expression was tested. Gene expression levels (measured as messenger RNA levels) are indicated by color scale: yellow = high expression levels; blue = low expression levels.[^WHITFIELD2003]

**Q6 (2 points; \~3 minutes)**: The expression levels of gene **lnos** is more correlated with:  
(***Select the one correct choice***)  
**a**) behavioral phenotype (nurse versus forager) than with age (young versus old).  
**b**) age (young versus old) than with behavioral phenotype (nurse versus forager).  

---

**Q7 (2 points; \~3 minutes)**: Based on the information and data provided, which of the following is a ***true statement***?
(***Select the one correct choice***)  
**a**) Nurse and forager phenotypes in bees are an example of a polyphenism because all workers have both nurse and forager genes/alleles (as shown in Figure 5).  
**b**) Nurse and forager phenotypes in bees are an example of a polymorphism because nurses and foragers must have different morphological features to do these different jobs.  
**c**) Nurse and forager phenotypes in bees are an example of a polyphenism because the worker gene has different alleles for nurse and forager phenotyeps (as shown in Figure 5).  

---

**Q8 (3 points; \~7 minutes)**: Based on the information and data provided, which of the following is a ***true statement***?
(***Select the one correct choice***. Then, ***explain your reasoning***.)  
**a**) young bees are usually nurses, but can become foragers if the nurse gene expression levels decrease.  
**b**) young bees are usually nurses, but can become foragers if epigenetic changes transform nurse bee genes into forager bee genes.  
**c**) epigenetic changes to the DNA/chromatin of young bees must be regulated by a mechanism that senses how many nurses and foragers there are in the colony.
