:::{admonition} Honor Code
This exam is open note/book/web, but must be done independently. Do not consult any other people (regardless of whether they are in or out of this course) or artificial intelligence (AI) in answering the questions. Handing in responses to the assignment for grading serves as your signature of the honor code.
:::

Answer all questions either electronically or by hand. Label each of your answers with the corresponding question number. Scan or convert your document to a good quality PDF. Upload to gradescope by the deadline -- make sure to tag all appropriate page(s) in your PDF for each question. 

**Please don’t hesitate to ask for clarifation on the wording of questions and/or expectations**. Key expectations are highlighted with font style. For any multiple choice question that asks for an explanation of your reasoning: provide a correct answer selection as well as your reasoning for selecting that answer - the reasoning should logically (and unabiguously) explain for your answer selection. Not all multiple choice questions require for reasoning.


## Section 1

A research group found that depolarizing (ie. activating) neurons in the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala (CeA) in a mouse immediately causes that mouse to produce FAPs for hunting behavior. Under natural conditions, neurons in CeA depolarize more (via input from a sensory filter) in response to a prey stimulus that is “stronger.” A stronger stimulus could be something that is moving faster and/or shaped more like a delicious insect. 

**Q1 (3 points; 5 minutes)**: This result is most relevant for explaining ____________ for specific behaviors in Lorenz’s model.  
(***Choose one option*** from the list below that fills in the blank most appropriately. THEN, ***briefly state why*** you chose that answer.)  
a) motivation  
b) innate releasing mechanisms  
c) sign stimuli  
d) sensory filters  
e) instincts


**Q2 (2 points; 3 minutes)**: Under natural conditions, visual sensory filters are responsible for making sure that mice only perform hunting FAPs toward prey items (such as crickets) and not toward inanimate objects or conspecifics. ***Complete the plot below*** so that it is consistent with the responses you would predict from a sensory filter that ***inhibits*** (hyperpolarizes) neurons in the CeA.

**Q3 (2 points; 2 minutes)**: Crickets serve as _______________ for hunting FAPs.  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below that fills in the blank appropriately.)  
a) motivation  
b) innate releasing mechanisms  
c) sign stimuli  
d) sensory filters  
e) instincts

**Q4 (2 points; 3 minutes)**: If the membrane potential of CeA neurons is more hyperpolarized, then a stronger stimulus would be needed to depolarize the neuron’s membrane above spike threshold. 
This neural mechanism is analogous to the Lorenz model of behavior because, in the Lorenz model, the stimulus threshold for a FAP _________________.  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below that fills in the blank appropriately.)  
a) is the same as the behavioral threshold  
b) decreases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold  
c) increases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold

**Q5 (2 points; 2 minutes)**: In analogy to the Lorenz model, what term would be the best to use to describe the stimulus strength needed to depolarize a CeA neuron above its voltage spike threshold?  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)  
a) behavioral threshold  
b) stimulus threshold  
c) action specific potential  
d) spontaneous drive


Recently, Todd and colleagues found, in mice, that the diurnal variation in aggression is mediated by a circuit linking SCN to VMHvl. SCN neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) project to subparaventricular zone (SPZ), which in turn send inhibitory projections to VMH89. Since SPZ cells are most active during the beginning of the daytime, they provide the strongest inhibitory control of VMH cells and reduce the level of aggression at that time. Eliminating the GABAergic transmission of the SPZ cells abolished the diurnal variation of aggression propensity.

**Q** (): These results show that the synaptic connection between SCZ and the VMH is [EXCITATORY / INHIBITORY] because the VMH neuron membrane potential [DEPOLARIZES / HYPERPOLARIZES] in response to activation of the SCZ. 

**Q** (): From this data, we can infer that:
a) SCZ neurotransmitters bind to potassium ion channels.
b) SCZ neurons synaptically change the potassium conductance in the VMH neurons
c) that the equilibrium potential of the ion ... must be lower than the membrane potential of the neuron
d) that the equilibrium potential of the ion ... must be higher than the membrane potential of the neuron

**Q** (): If SCN neuron activity suppresses aggresion, what type of synaptic connection exists between SCN and SCZ? Explain your reasoning.
