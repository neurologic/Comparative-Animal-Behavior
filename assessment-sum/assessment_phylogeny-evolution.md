***Q (2 point)*** Select a correct sentence to add to the caption for Figure 1.   
**a)** *Phylogeny of finches with the character mapping of feeding behavior overlaid*   
**b)** *Phylogeny of 11 extant species of finches*  
**c)** *Phylogeny of finches with the character mapping and ancestral state reconstruction of feeding behavior overlaid*  

***Q (2 point)*** Select a correct sentence to add to the caption for Figure 1.   
**a)** *The nodes (labeled a, b, c, and d) mark potential points of phenotype divergence.*    
**b)** *The nodes (labeled a, b, c, and d) mark potential points of phenotype convergence.*  
**c)** *The nodes (labeled a, b, c, and d) mark the root of divergent extant species.*  

***Q (2 points)*** Which node (*a, b, c, or d*) represents the last common ancestor for the entire set of extant species shown?

***Q (6 points)*** Why is it least likely (by parsimony) that the last common ancestor of all extant species shown was a *folivore*? Answer this question in 1-3 concise sentences in terms of all possible alternate hypotheses and the quantitative results of your analysis under each hypothesis.  

***Q (4 points)*** Which node (*a, b, c, or d*) represents the last common ancestor for all Ground finches and Tree finches? What was the most likely behavioral trait of that LCA (*in your analysis, consider all information available in the Figure*)?  

***Q (2 points)*** Which node (*a, b, c, or d*) represents the last common ancestor for all extant ground finch species?

***Q (2 points)*** Consider the scenario in which two species exhibit a similar behavioral trait and are incorrectly separated in a phylogenetic tree such that, by parsimony, their most recent common ancestor exhibited a different behavioral trait. In this situation, you would misinterpret their similar traits as evidence of [*convergence* / *divergence*/ *shared ancestry*] rather than correctly identifying [*convergence* / *divergence*/ *shared ancestry*]

## Section 2: Evolutionary models for feeding behavior in chicks

In birds, let's consider two behavioral phenotypes associated with feeding behavior: 1) beg for food by making loud vocalizations ('*beggers*') and 2) do nothing while waiting for food from the parent ('*silent*'). Parent birds will feed their chicks no matter what, but loud vocalizations are so attention-grabbing that they will preferentially feed vocalizing chicks over *silent* chicks. We will assume that the amount of food a parent is able to gather is limited, and we will call this value $f$ (for simplicity, assume that the amount of food that the parent is able to gather does not depend on the behavior of its chicks). Begging chicks get all of the food, *but* they also expend a lot of energy to produce vocalizations (a factor that we will call $e$) and the vocalizations make them more noticable to predators (a factor that we will call $p$). 

***Q (3 points)*** Given these factors, the most reasonable optimality theory model for the total net fitness of individual chicks ($F$) would be formulated as:  
(***Choose one option from below and explain your reasoning.***)  
**a**) $f = - e - p$  
**b**) $F = f - e - p$  
**c**) $F = -f + e + p$  
**d**) $F = f + e + p$  

***Q (3 points)*** Given the optimality theory model you chose, under what conditions would you predict that the *silent* phenotype would be stable at evolutionary equilibrium?    
(***Choose one option from below and explain your reasoning.***)  
**a**) When $f$ (the food gathered by the parent) is greater for *silent* chicks than for *begging* chicks (assuming all other factors are the same for both phenotypes)  
**b**) When $e$ is greater for *begging* chicks than for *silent* chicks (assuming all other factors are the same for both phenotypes)  
**c**) When $p$ is greater for *silent* chicks than for *begging* chicks (assuming all other factors are the same for both phenotypes)  

***Q (2 points)*** According to the optimality theory model, the average fitness of the *silent* phenotype could depend on:  
(***Choose one option from below***)
**a)** whether conspecifics begged or were *silent*  
**b)** the number of predators in the environment (and therefore the risk of predation)  
**c)** whether $e > p$ or $p < e$ for the *begging* phenotype

**Figure 3:** *Game theory model of *begging* versus *silent* feeding behavior phenotypes in chicks (following convension: columns = phenotypes of conspecifics; rows = net fitness of each phenotype being assessed). The factors in the model are the same as in the optimality theory model: $f$ (the food gathered by the parent), $e$ (energy to produce vocalizations), $p$ (likelihood of being noticed by predators).* 

***Q (4 points)*** According to the game theory model, beggers would have a greater net fitness in a population of [*BEGGING* / *SILENT*] chicks than in a population of [*BEGGING* / *SILENT*] chicks.  
(***Choose the correct words to complete the first sentence. Then select one option from below that provides the appropriate reasoning based on the game theory model.***)   
**a)** However, this scenario is not possible because the *silent* phenotype is not the evolutionarily stable phenotype.   
**b)** However, this scenario is not possible because the *silent* phenotype has a lower net fitness than the *begging* phenotype in a population of *begging* chicks.  
**c)** However, this scenario is not possible because *begging* is the only evolutionarily stable phenotype.  
**d)** However, this scenario would not be possible if the *silent* phenotype had a lower net fitness than the *begging* phenotype in a population of *begging* chicks.  

***Q (3 points)*** According to the game theory model, state the mathematical conditions when *begging* would be the evolutionarily stable phenotype (ie. when *silent* phenotype cannot "invade" a population of beggers). (***Show your work to set up the necessary inequality(ies), and simplify so that all of the 'fitness increasing' factors are on one side and all of the 'fitness decreasing' factors are on the other.***)

***Q (3 points)*** According to the game theory model, state the mathematical conditions when *silent* would be the evolutionarily stable phenotype. (***Show your work to set up the necessary inequality(ies), and simplify so that all of the 'fitness increasing' factors are on one side and all of the 'fitness decreasing' factors are on the other.***)

***Q (2 points)*** (Refer to the conditions you calculated in Q\____) A population comprised of all begging chicks would be evolutionarily stable when:  
(***Choose the one correct option to complete the sentence***)   
**a)** the likelihood of predation is less than the food obtained from the parent.   
**b)** the likelihood of predation is less than the food that the parent is able to gather.  
**c)** $f$ is actually a negative number.  
**d)** the combined fitness deficit caused by the increased likelihood of predation and energy needed to vocalize are less than half of the food that the parent is able to gather.  

***Q (2 points)*** Which is a more appropriate model (optimality theory or game theory) for understanding the feeding behavior of chicks, and why? 
(***Choose the one correct option***)  
a) Game Theory, because the fitness of the feeding behavior phenotypes likely do *NOT* depend on the strategies of conspecifics.  
b) Game Theory, because the fitness of the feeding behaviors phenotypes likely *DO* depend on the strategies of conspecifics.  
c) Optimality Theory, because the fitness of the feeding behavior phenotypess likely *DO* depend on the strategies of conspecifics.  
d) Game theory, because a mixed population of *begging* and *silent* phenotypes is evolutionarily stable, and game theory is the only type of model that can predict a mixed population.  

***Q (2 points)*** An assumption of both of optimality theory and game theory models is that:  
**a)** the models can predict the evolutionarily stable behavior of a species.   
**b)** behavioral phenotypes change across phylogeny because of evolution.  
**c)** behavioral phenotypes change across phylogeny because of natural selection.
**d)** the fitness of individuals depends on the phenotype of conspecifics.
**e)** natural selection reduces phenotypic variance among a species.  

## Section 3 Ancestral state reconstruction correction

A student who studied cannabalism among snakes for their capstone provided the following figure and explanation as part of their phylogenetic analysis of the behavior:

:::

"*In this case, the ancestral trait is cannibalistic behavior because the species “Sistrurus catenatus" has a direct lineage to the common ancestor. This species does show cannibal-like behavior, thus the ancestral trait is cannibalism.*"  

***Q (3 points)*** Why was this an incorrect analysis?

## You can do it better

Improve these two excerpts from editorials on animal behavior. Make at least two major improvements to each excerpt. Highlight your changes and briefly explain the reason for the change using footnote-style annotation. 

One
:::{epigraph}
A phylogeny is a study of the relationships among a group of organisms. Animals that evolved from a common ancestor evolve in different ways. They also develop different traits at different times. Every species can be connected to one common ancestor that they all evolved from. In this case, phylogeny is used on rattlesnakes. (Figure 1) The rattlesnakes were investigated for showing the trait of cannibalistic behavior or not showing the trait. Out of many species, only 6 show cannibalistic behavior. For the species that do show the trait, they seem to come up in very distant relationships. Very few of the species that are close in evolution share the trait. Also, based on just the phylogeny the ancestral trait can be predicted. An ancestral trait is a trait that the very first ancestor, that the species evolved from, shows. In this case, the ancestral trait is cannibalistic behavior because the species “Sistrurus catenatus" has a direct lineage to the common ancestor. This species does show cannibal-like behavior, thus the ancestral trait is cannibalism.

:::{epigraph}
Infanticide has a high benefit and a low cost. The high benefit is because eating a snake's offspring can bring a lot of nutrients into the snake's diet. Some snakes eat their young because they need to compensate for their lost energy when producing offspring. The cost is low because it is easy for the snake to eat their young, there is very little risk to the parent snake itself since the offspring has no means of defending itself. Since the benefit outweighs the cost this is a viable option and could explain why rattlesnakes partake in cannibalism. The main benefit of infanticide is not losing the energy that went into reproduction.

Code breaking of escape by tentacled snake (read a Ken Catania paper?)

What is the FAP of the fish? what is the sign stimulus? What is the code-breaking behavior? How would the escape behavior of fish likely start to differ in environments where tentacled snakes live? Why might the escape behavior persist 'as-is' even in environments where tentacled snakes live (ie. what other selection pressures are there on the escape behavior)?
