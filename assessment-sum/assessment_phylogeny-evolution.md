**Case Study: Social behavior in Bathyergidae**

There are, broadly, several categories of social behavior: solitary, social, and eusocial

:::{glossary}

solitary
	Individuals live and behave alone (except during mating usually)

social
	Individuals group together for some activities, but each maintain reproductive independence. 

eusocial
	Some individuals among the social group give up their own reproductive opportunities to help others reproduce.

Check out the [phylogeny of Bathyergidae on OpenTree](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/opentree13.4@mrcaott45520ott692678/Bathyergidae--Petromuridae). 

Bathyergidae is comprised of 6 Genera: *Heterocephalus, Bathyergus, Fukomys, Cryptomys, Georychus,* and *Heliophobius*. There are only two species among the Bathyergidae family that are eusocial: *Fukomys demarensis* and *Heterocephalus glaber*. 

***Q: How many extant species are within the Bathyergidae family?***

If all extent species from the heliophobius genus are not eusocial, then it is more likely that the LCA of all heliophobius was not eusocial. The same logic applies to Bathyergus, Cryptomys, and Georychus. Likewise, the LCA of all Fukomys was likely not eusocial. To construct the behavior of the LCA for all Bathyergidae, We can consider a 'reduced' tree of all genera within this family.

***Q: Why is the Heterocephalus genus LCA eusocial?***

***Q: Which hypothesis would you reject based on parsimony?***

*Outgroups* can help resolve ambiguity in ancestral state reconstruction.

***Q: Why is it important to include outgroups in an ancestral state reconstruction?***

## You can do it better

Improve these two excerpts from editorials on animal behavior. Make at least two majore improvements to each excerpt. Highlight your changes and briefly explain the reason for the change using footnote-style annotation. 

One
:::{epigraph}
A phylogeny is a study of the relationships among a group of organisms. Animals that evolved from a common ancestor evolve in different ways. They also develop different traits at different times. Every species can be connected to one common ancestor that they all evolved from. In this case, phylogeny is used on rattlesnakes. (Figure 1) The rattlesnakes were investigated for showing the trait of cannibalistic behavior or not showing the trait. Out of many species, only 6 show cannibalistic behavior. For the species that do show the trait, they seem to come up in very distant relationships. Very few of the species that are close in evolution share the trait. Also, based on just the phylogeny the ancestral trait can be predicted. An ancestral trait is a trait that the very first ancestor, that the species evolved from, shows. In this case, the ancestral trait is cannibalistic behavior because the species â€œSistrurus catenatus has a direct lineage to the common ancestor. This species does show cannibal-like behavior thus the ancestral trait is cannibalism.

:::{epigraph}
Infanticide has a high benefit and a low cost. The high benefit is because eating a snake's offspring can bring a lot of nutrients into the snake's diet. Some snakes eat their young because they need to compensate for their lost energy when producing offspring. The cost is low because it is easy for the snake to eat their young, there is very little risk to the parent snake itself since the offspring has no means of defending itself. Since the benefit outweighs the cost this is a viable option and could explain why rattlesnakes partake in cannibalism. The main benefit of infanticide is not losing the energy that went into reproduction.

Code breaking of escape by tentacled snake (read a Ken Catania paper?)

What is the FAP of the fish? what is the sign stimulus? What is the code-breaking behavior? How would the escape behavior of fish likely start to differ in environments where tentacled snakes live? Why might the escape behavior persist 'as-is' even in environments where tentacled snakes live (ie. what other selection pressures are there on the escape behavior)?
