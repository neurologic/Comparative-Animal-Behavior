**Figure 1:** *The 13 extant species shown comprise the Genus: thrush. Yellow = migrate. Blue = resident (do not migrate)*. 


***Q1: Figure 1 shows a [ phylogeny / character mapping / ancestral state reconstruction ] of migratory behavior among the genus thrushes. (Choose one and re-write the sentence)***

***Q2: Based on an argument of parsimony, consider the phylogeny of all species from the last common ancestor (LCA) at "A" (green arrow). If the LCA at A was _______________, there would have been _______ evolutionary changes. If the LCA at A was _______________, there would have been ___________ evolutionary changes. (Re-write the sentence with the blanks filled in based on the results under each alternative hypothesis)***

***Q3: How would an analysis starting from "B" (red arrow) change your conclusions (based on an argument of parsimony) about the LCA at "A"?***

***Q4: Finally, by performing an ancestral state reconstruction of the LCA at "C" (black arrow), you would conclude that _____________ behavior evolved independently _________ times among thrush. In other words, ________________ is a [derived / inherited] trait among thrush.***


## Section 2: Mate-finding behavior in crickets

In crickets, there are two major phenotype variants for mate-finding behavior: ***singing*** and ***silent***. 

***Silent*** crickets travel around to search silently for potential mates.

***Singing*** crickets have specialized wing anatomy (with a *file* and a *scraper* that they use to produce a species-specific [song](https://youtu.be/GP5NpXcYc8A). This song attracts females to them (rather than them needing to go searching for females). 

The songs of singing male crickets are very attractive to females. They are able to attract more females than they would otherwise be able to find by silent searching. However, predators of crickets can also hear the song. Singing crickets attract predators and singing therefore increases their predation risk compared to if they were silent. 

We can use either optimality theory or game theory to examine the evolutionary explanations for these mate-finding phenotype variants. First, you will investigate an optimality theory model (Figure 2), then you will investigate a game theory model (Figure 4), and finally you will compare the two.

**Figure 2:** *Optimality theory model of two alternative behavioral phenotypes of advertisement behavior in male crickets. There are two factors hypothesized to exert selective pressure on advertisement behavior in crickets. $m$ = mating success; $k$ = risk of predation.*

***Q5: According to the optimality theory model (Figure 2), for the singing phenotype to be evolutionarily stable over the silent phenotype, the increase in mating success from singing must be [bigger / smaller] than the increase in _________________ due to singing.***

***Q6: According to the optimality theory model (Figure 2), the average fitness of the singing phenotype could depend on:  
		1. whether conspecifics sang or were silent  
		2. the number of predators in the environment  
		3. whether $m > k$ or $m < k$ for the silent phenotype  
(Select the one correct choice. Then provide an explanation why the two answers that you did not choose were incorrect)***


***Q7: Examine the data in Figure 3. Under which condition (A or B) would you predict singing will be the optimal phenotype (versus silent)?***

**Figure 4:** *Game theory model of two alternative behavioral phenotypes of advertisement behavior in male crickets. Singing male crickets advertise themselves to potential female mates by singing. Silent male crickets do not advertise themselves to female mates. However, silent male crickets are attracted to the song of singing male crickets and try to sneak mating with females that are also attracted to the songs. There are three factors hypothesized to exert selective pressure on advertisement behavior in crickets. $k$ = the risk/likelihood of predation; $b$ = boost to mating success gained by singing compared to being silent; $n$ = mating success without any singing advertisements.* **NOTE KP: EDIT -N to just N**

## You can do it better

Improve these two excerpts from editorials on animal behavior. Make at least two majore improvements to each excerpt. Highlight your changes and briefly explain the reason for the change using footnote-style annotation.

:::{epigraph}
A phylogeny is a study of the relationships among a group of organisms. Animals that evolved from a common ancestor evolve in different ways. They also develop different traits at different times. Every species can be connected to one common ancestor that they all evolved from. In this case, phylogeny is used on rattlesnakes. (Figure 1) The rattlesnakes were investigated for showing the trait of cannibalistic behavior or not showing the trait. Out of many species, only 6 show cannibalistic behavior. For the species that do show the trait, they seem to come up in very distant relationships. Very few of the species that are close in evolution share the trait. Also, based on just the phylogeny the ancestral trait can be predicted. An ancestral trait is a trait that the very first ancestor, that the species evolved from, shows. In this case, the ancestral trait is cannibalistic behavior because the species â€œSistrurus catenatus has a direct lineage to the common ancestor. This species does show cannibal-like behavior thus the ancestral trait is cannibalism.

:::{epigraph}
Infanticide has a high benefit and a low cost. The high benefit is because eating a snake's offspring can bring a lot of nutrients into the snake's diet. Some snakes eat their young because they need to compensate for their lost energy when producing offspring. The cost is low because it is easy for the snake to eat their young, there is very little risk to the parent snake itself since the offspring has no means of defending itself. Since the benefit outweighs the cost this is a viable option and could explain why rattlesnakes partake in cannibalism. The main benefit of infanticide is not losing the energy that went into reproduction.

Code breaking of escape by tentacled snake (read a Ken Catania paper?)

What is the FAP of the fish? what is the sign stimulus? What is the code-breaking behavior? How would the escape behavior of fish likely start to differ in environments where tentacled snakes live? Why might the escape behavior persist 'as-is' even in environments where tentacled snakes live (ie. what other selection pressures are there on the escape behavior)?
