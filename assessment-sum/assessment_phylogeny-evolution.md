# Assessment 2: Observation and Analysis of Behavior


Code breaking of escape by tentacled snake (read a Ken Catania paper?)

What is the FAP of the fish? what is the sign stimulus? What is the code-breaking behavior? How would the escape behavior of fish likely start to differ in environments where tentacled snakes live? Why might the escape behavior persist 'as-is' even in environments where tentacled snakes live (ie. what other selection pressures are there on the escape behavior)?
