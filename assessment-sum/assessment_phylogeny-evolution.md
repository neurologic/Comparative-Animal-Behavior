**Figure 1:** *The 13 extant species shown comprise the Genus: thrush. Yellow = migration behavior. Blue = resident behavior (does not migrate)*. 


***Q1 (1 point; \~ 2 minutes): (Choose the correct word from the bracketed list and re-write the sentence).  
Figure 1 shows a [ phylogeny / character mapping / ancestral state reconstruction ] of migratory behavior among the genus thrushes.***

***Q2 (4 point; \~ 5 minutes): (Re-write the following sentences with the blanks filled in based on the results under each alternative hypothesis. You can include diagrams to show your work for possible partial credit if you fill in the blanks wrong.)  
Based on an argument of parsimony, consider the phylogeny of the 6 species descendent from the last common ancestor (LCA) at "A" (Figure 1, green arrow). If the LCA at A was _______________, there would have been _________ evolutionary changes. If the LCA at A was _______________, there would have been ___________ evolutionary changes.***

***Q3 (3 point; \~ 7 minutes): How would an analysis starting from "B" (Figure 1, red arrow; 7 extant species) change your conclusions (based on an argument of parsimony) about the LCA at "A"? Your answer and reasoning should include: the results of the new analysis at B, the conclusion about the LCA at "B" based on those results, and how that conclusion effects the LCA at "A".***

***Q4 (3 point; \~ 7 minutes): (Re-write the following sentences with blanks filled in and appropriate word choices from brackets)  
Finally, by performing an ancestral state reconstruction of the LCA at "C" (Figure 1, black arrow; all 13 extant species), I would conclude that _____________ behavior evolved independently _________ times among thrush becase the LCA of all thrush was most likely ___________. In other words, ________________ behavior is a [derived / inherited] trait among thrush.***


## Section 2: Mate-finding behavior in crickets

*(this section could take \~45 minutes total)*

*(intruduction reading \~5 minutes)*

In crickets, there are two major phenotype variants for mate-finding behavior in males: ***singing*** and ***silent***. 

***Silent*** crickets travel around to search silently for potential female mates.

***Singing*** crickets have specialized wing anatomy that they use to produce a species-specific [song](https://youtu.be/GP5NpXcYc8A). This song attracts females to them (rather than them needing to go searching for females). 

The songs of singing male crickets are very attractive to females. Singing crickets are able to attract more females than they would otherwise be able to find by silent searching. However, predators of crickets can also hear the song. Singing therefore increases their predation risk compared to if they were silent. 

We can use either optimality theory or game theory to examine the evolutionary explanations for these mate-finding phenotype variants. First, you will investigate an optimality theory model (Figure 2), then you will investigate a game theory model (Figure 4), and finally you will compare the two.

**Figure 2:** *Optimality theory model for two alternative behavioral phenotypes of mate-finding behavior in male crickets. There are two factors hypothesized to exert selective pressure on mate-finding behavior in crickets. $m$ = mating success; $k$ = risk of predation.*

***Q5 (2 point; \~ 3 minutes): (Refer to Figure 2. Re-write the following sentence with blanks filled in and appropriate word choices from brackets)  
According to the optimality theory model, the singing phenotype would be the optimal phenotype (favored by natural selection) if the increase in mating success for singers (versus silents) was [ bigger / smaller ] than the increase in _________________ for singers (versus silents).***

***Q6 (2 point; \~ 5 minutes): (Refer to Figure 2. Select the one correct choice. Then provide an explanation why the two answers that you did not choose were incorrect)  
According to the optimality theory model, the average fitness of the singing phenotype could depend on:  
		a) whether conspecifics sang or were silent  
		b) the number of predators in the environment (and therefore the risk of predation)  
		c) whether $m > k$ or $m < k$ for the silent phenotype***

***Q7 (3 point; \~ 7 minutes): (Refer to both Figure 2 and Figure 3)  
Examine the example data plotted in Figure 3 and answer both of the following questions:    
	1. Under which condition (A or B) would you predict singing will be the optimal phenotype (versus silent)?   
	2. Provide an explanation for your answer by using the optimality theory model $F=m-k$ to describe your reasoning.***

**Figure 4:** *Game theory model of singing versus silent mate-finding behavior phenotypes in male crickets. Columns = phenotypes of conspecifics. Rows = phenotypes being assessed. As you already know, singing male crickets advertise themselves to potential female mates by singing and silent male crickets do not advertise themselves to female mates. Interestingly, silent male crickets are attracted to the song of singing male crickets and try to sneak mating with females that are also attracted to the songs. There are three factors hypothesized to exert selective pressure on these phenotypes. $k$ = the risk/likelihood of predation; $b$ = mating success taken by singing crickets from silent crickets; $n$ = difference in mating success without any singing male crickets in the population around to attract females.* 

***Q8 (3 point; \~ 5 minutes): (Refer to Figure 4. Re-write the following sentences with blanks filled in and appropriate word choice from brackets)  
According to the game theory model, the fitness of singing [ DOES / DOES NOT ] depend on the behavioral phenotype of conspecifics. When conspecifics are singers, the fitness of a singer is _____________. When conspecifics are silent, a singer has an average fitness of ___________.***

***Q9 (2 point; \~ 3 minutes): (Refer to Figure 4 and show your work)  
Find the mathematical conditions (simplified inequalitie(s)) when a population comprised of all singers would be evolutionarily stable (ie. when silent phenotype cannot "invade" the population).***

***Q10 (1 point; \~ 3 minutes): (Describe the conditions you calculated in Q9 by picking the best option to complete the following sentence)  
A population comprised of all singers would be evolutionarily stable when:  
		a) the risk of predation due to singing is less than the increase in mating success due to singing.   
		b) the risk of predation due to singing is greater than the increase in mating success due to singing.  
		c) $b$ is actually a negative numbner.  
		d) the risk of predation due to singing is less than both the increase in mating success due to singing and the decrease in mating success due to the absence of singers in the population.***

***Q11 (3 point; \~ 5 minutes): (Refer to Figure 4 and show your work) Under what mathematical conditions would you predict a population comprising both singing and silent crickets simultaneously (ie. a mixed phenotype population)?***

***Q12 (1 point; \~ 3 minutes): (Select the one correct choice)  
Which is a more appropriate model (optimality theory or game theory) for understanding the mate-finding behavior of crickets, and why?  
		a) Game Theory, because the fitness of the mating behaviors likely do NOT depend on the strategies of conspecifics.  
		b) Game Theory, because the fitness of the mating behaviors likely DO depend on the strategies of conspecifics.  
		c) Optimality Theory, because the fitness of the mating behaviors likely DO depend on the strategies of conspecifics.  
		d) Game theory, because a mixed population of singing and silent is likely always evolutionarily stable.***

## You can do it better

Improve these two excerpts from editorials on animal behavior. Make at least two majore improvements to each excerpt. Highlight your changes and briefly explain the reason for the change using footnote-style annotation. 

One
:::{epigraph}
A phylogeny is a study of the relationships among a group of organisms. Animals that evolved from a common ancestor evolve in different ways. They also develop different traits at different times. Every species can be connected to one common ancestor that they all evolved from. In this case, phylogeny is used on rattlesnakes. (Figure 1) The rattlesnakes were investigated for showing the trait of cannibalistic behavior or not showing the trait. Out of many species, only 6 show cannibalistic behavior. For the species that do show the trait, they seem to come up in very distant relationships. Very few of the species that are close in evolution share the trait. Also, based on just the phylogeny the ancestral trait can be predicted. An ancestral trait is a trait that the very first ancestor, that the species evolved from, shows. In this case, the ancestral trait is cannibalistic behavior because the species “Sistrurus catenatus has a direct lineage to the common ancestor. This species does show cannibal-like behavior thus the ancestral trait is cannibalism.

:::{epigraph}
Infanticide has a high benefit and a low cost. The high benefit is because eating a snake's offspring can bring a lot of nutrients into the snake's diet. Some snakes eat their young because they need to compensate for their lost energy when producing offspring. The cost is low because it is easy for the snake to eat their young, there is very little risk to the parent snake itself since the offspring has no means of defending itself. Since the benefit outweighs the cost this is a viable option and could explain why rattlesnakes partake in cannibalism. The main benefit of infanticide is not losing the energy that went into reproduction.

Code breaking of escape by tentacled snake (read a Ken Catania paper?)

What is the FAP of the fish? what is the sign stimulus? What is the code-breaking behavior? How would the escape behavior of fish likely start to differ in environments where tentacled snakes live? Why might the escape behavior persist 'as-is' even in environments where tentacled snakes live (ie. what other selection pressures are there on the escape behavior)?
