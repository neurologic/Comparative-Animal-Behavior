# Neural and Hormonal mechanisms; and Endogenouse Rhythms


## Section 1

Q1 (2 points; minutes): A research group finds that if they depolarize neurons in a brain region called the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala (CeA) in a mouse, then the mouse generates the coordinated behavioral actions of hunting. This result is most consistent with Lorenz’s hypothesis that there is/are ____________ for specific behaviors. 
(Choose one option from the list below that fills in the blank appropriately. THEN, briefly state why you chose that answer.)
1. motivation
2. innate releasing mechanisms
3. sign stimuli 
4. sensory filtering
5. instincts


Q ( points; minutes): Under natural conditions, visual sensory filters are responsible for making sure that mice only perform hunting actions toward prey items such as crickets and not toward inanimate objects or conspecifics. Complete the plot below so that it is consistent with the responses you would predict from a sensory filter that inhibits (hyperpolarizes) neurons in the CeA.

Q ( points; minutes): The cricket serves as a(n) _______________ for hunting fixed action patterns.

When CeA neurons are active animals display hunting behavior. 
A) A Lorenz model summarizing how and why hunting actions are produced. B&C) Responses of neurons in the CeA that receive excitatory synaptic input from sensory filters tuned to the image of prey moving through the environment. The same sensory stimulus was presented in both B and C (the same stimulus type with the same stimulus “strength”) and the horizontal bar under the x axis marks when the stimulus was presented.
:::


Q ( points; minutes): When neurons in CeA are depolarized above their voltage spike threshold (as in Figure 3C), they cause a mouse to produce the coordinated actions of hunting. 
In the two plots below (labeled A and B) draw what figure \___ A would look like if:  
(Ai) the stimulus in Figures \___ B&C were presented at time X.   
(Aii) the stimulus in Figures \___ B&C were presented at time Y.  
Make your plots clear so that your prediction under each condition (stimulus presented at time X or time Y) is unambiguous. The original plot from Figure \___ A has been included (in gray lines) to help you more clearly show your prediction for how the plot will differ in Ai and Aii.

Q ( points; minutes): Figure \___ D shows that neurons in CeA depolarize more in response to a prey stimulus that is “stronger” (ie. moving faster and/or shaped more like a delicious insect). If the potential across a neuron’s membrane is more hyperpolarized, then a stronger stimulus would be needed to depolarize the neuron’s membrane above spike threshold. 
This neural mechanism is analogous to the Lorenz model of behavior because, in the Lorenz model, the stimulus threshold for an action:  
(choose the one correct statement to complete this sentence)
1. is the same as the behavioral threshold
2. decreases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold
3. increases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold

Q ( points; minutes): Figure \___ B&C show the response (change in polarization) of a CeA neuron in response to a stimulus of the same strength. PLOT the relationship that you would predict between: the polarization/voltage of a CeA neuron before the stimulus is presented (the x-axis) and the stimulus strength needed to depolarize a CeA neuron above its voltage spike threshold (the y-axis) (ie Figure \___ E).


Q ( points; minutes): In analogy to the Lorenz model, what term would be the best to use to describe the metric on the y-axis in Figure 3E (ie. the stimulus strength needed to depolarize a CeA neuron above its voltage spike threshold)?  
(choose the one correct option)
1. Behavioral threshold
2. Stimulus threshold
3. Action specific potential
4. Spontaneous drive

## Section 2

Q ( points; minutes): Which of the following gait patterns would this CPG circuit produce.  
(**KP: draw the options out with plots of muscle contraction over time**_)
1. hopping
2. alternating left-right
3. alternating left-right and front-back
3. gallop

Q ( points; minutes): The excitatory command neuron that activates this locomotion CPG circuit has receptors for melatonin.  
In an animal that walks around more at night, would you expect melatonin to decrease or increase the membrane potential of the command neuron? Why?


## Section 3

Actograms of a nocturnal rodent across a 24 hour cycle over multiple days. The rodent lives in CT where the sun goes down during the night and the sky is darkest in the middle of the night (24:00). A-D Actograms of the rodent under 4 different conditions (refer to questions 42 – 45 for the specifics of each condition). Black circles denote activity in/out of the rodent’s burrow at that time on that day. In B, the gray bars denote the time of day during which the moonlight is brightest. Assume environmental light pollution is not a factor in any of these conditions.  
:::


Q ( points; minutes): If Figure \___ A corresponds to an experiment in which the rodent is being kept in a lab under constant darkness, which of the following conclusions best fit the data:  
(choose the one correct option)
1. The rodent does not have an endogenous clock
2. The rodent has an endogenous clock
3. The rodent’s endogenous clock is entrained by darkness. 

Q ( points; minutes): During times of increased predation risk or low food stores, this rodent is known to follow the activity pattern in Figure 9B. Which of the following statements best describes the results shown in Figure \___B:  
(choose the one correct option)
1. The rodent is least active during darkness because that is when predators are most active.
2. The rodent’s behavior cannot be predicted by the time of day, instead it uses light to entrain its endogenous rhythm. 
3. The rodent’s activity is not controlled by the amount of available light. This makes its behavior unpredictable to predators and increases its chance of survival.
4. The rodent has an endogenous circadian rhythm that is entrained by sunlight, but its normal nocturnal activity is inhibited by light-sensitive neurons. This means that it will only be active when it is hardest for predators to see it, which increases its chance of survival.
5. Under increased predation risk, the rodent exhibits “free-running” activity.


Q ( points; minutes): What would most likely cause a rodent to exhibit the activity pattern shown in Figure \___C as opposed to a “normal” activity pattern shown in Figure \___D?  
(choose the one correct option)
1. Damage to the light-sensing neurons in the eye
2. Damage to neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus
3. Damage to the locomotion pattern-generating circuits (CPGs for locomotion)
