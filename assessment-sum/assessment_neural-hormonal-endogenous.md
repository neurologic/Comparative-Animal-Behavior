# Neural and Hormonal mechanisms; Endogenous Rhythms


## Section 1

A research group found that depolarizing (ie. activating) neurons in the Central Nucleus of the Amygdala (CeA) in a mouse immediately causes that mouse to produce FAPs for hunting behavior. Under natural conditions, neurons in CeA depolarize more (via input from a sensory filter) in response to a prey stimulus that is “stronger.” A stronger stimulus could be something that is moving faster and/or shaped more like a delicious insect. 

**Q1 (3 points; 5 minutes)**: This result is most relevant for explaining ____________ for specific behaviors in Lorenz’s model.  
(***Choose one option*** from the list below that fills in the blank most appropriately. THEN, ***briefly state why*** you chose that answer.)  
a) motivation  
b) innate releasing mechanisms  
c) sign stimuli  
d) sensory filters  
e) instincts


**Q2 (2 points; 3 minutes)**: Under natural conditions, visual sensory filters are responsible for making sure that mice only perform hunting FAPs toward prey items (such as crickets) and not toward inanimate objects or conspecifics. ***Complete the plot below*** so that it is consistent with the responses you would predict from a sensory filter that ***inhibits*** (hyperpolarizes) neurons in the CeA.

**Q3 (2 points; 2 minutes)**: Crickets serve as _______________ for hunting FAPs.  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below that fills in the blank appropriately.)  
a) motivation  
b) innate releasing mechanisms  
c) sign stimuli  
d) sensory filters  
e) instincts

**Q4 (2 points; 3 minutes)**: If the membrane potential of CeA neurons is more hyperpolarized, then a stronger stimulus would be needed to depolarize the neuron’s membrane above spike threshold. 
This neural mechanism is analogous to the Lorenz model of behavior because, in the Lorenz model, the stimulus threshold for a FAP _________________.  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below that fills in the blank appropriately.)  
a) is the same as the behavioral threshold  
b) decreases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold  
c) increases as the action specific potential gets closer to the behavioral threshold

**Q5 (2 points; 2 minutes)**: In analogy to the Lorenz model, what term would be the best to use to describe the stimulus strength needed to depolarize a CeA neuron above its voltage spike threshold?  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)  
a) behavioral threshold  
b) stimulus threshold  
c) action specific potential  
d) spontaneous drive

**Figure 1** A central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion. Inhibitory synapses are denoted with a filled circle line ending. Excitatory synapses are denoted with a bar line ending. **Limb CPG**: The extensor (E) and flexor (F) motor neurons for each limb communicate with each other via inhibitory synapses. Each limb CPG (for all four limbs of a quadrapedal animal) is represented in the Gait CPG as a circle with a tilde symbol inside. **Gait CPG**: Limb CPGs are connected with each other to coordinate the movement among all limbs during locomotion. **TABLE**: The table at the bottom shows three different gait patterns (**A**, **B**, and **C**). At each moment in time (from left to right), the horizontal bars denote when the extensor muscle for each limb is contracted. 

**Q6 (2 points; 5 minutes)**: Which of the gait patterns shown in the Figure 1 table (**A**, **B**, or **C**) would the Gait CPG in Figure 1 produce? (***Choose the one correct option***)

**Q7 (3 points; 7 minutes)**: The excitatory command neuron (*not shown*) that activates this Gait CPG in Figure 1 has receptors for melatonin. In an animal that locomotes more at night than during the day, would you expect melatonin to ***decrease or increase*** the membrane potential of the command neuron? ***Briefly explain why***.

**Figure 2** Actograms of a nocturnal rodent across a 24 hour cycle over multiple days. Each panel (**A**-**D**) reflect the activity pattern under a different condition (*as explained in questions Q8-Q10*). This rodent species lives in CT where the sun goes down during the evening and the sky is darkest around the middle of the night (24:00). Black circles denote activity in/out of the rodent’s burrow at that time on that day. In **B**, the gray bars denote the time of day during which the moonlight is brightest. Assume environmental light pollution is not a factor in any of these conditions.  


**Q8 (3 points; 7 minutes)**: If ***Figure 2A*** corresponds to a rodent being kept in a lab under constant darkness and Figure 2D corresponds to a rodent under a natural light-dark cycle, which of the following conclusions best fit the data:  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below. THEN ***briefly explain*** your reasoning.)  
a) The rodent does not have an endogenous clock  
b) The rodent has an endogenous clock  
c) The rodent’s endogenous clock is entrained by darkness. 

**Q9 (2 points; 5 minutes)**: During times of increased predation risk, this rodent is known to follow the activity pattern in Figure 2B. Which of the following statements best describes the results shown in Figure 2B:  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below.)  
a) The rodent is least active during darkness.  
b) The rodent’s behavior cannot be predicted by the time of day, instead it uses light to entrain its endogenous rhythm.  
c) The rodent’s activity is not controlled by the amount of available light. This makes its behavior unpredictable to predators and increases its chance of survival.  
d) The rodent has an endogenous circadian rhythm that is entrained by sunlight, but its normal nocturnal activity is inhibited by light-sensitive neurons.   
e) Under increased predation risk, the rodent exhibits “free-running” activity.


**Q10 (3 points; 7 minutes)**: What would most likely cause a rodent to exhibit the activity pattern shown in Figure 2C as opposed to a “normal” activity pattern shown in Figure 2D?   
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below. THEN ***briefly explain*** your reasoning.)  
a) Damage to the light-sensing neurons in the eye  
b) Damage to neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus  
c) Damage to the locomotion pattern-generating circuits (CPGs for locomotion)
