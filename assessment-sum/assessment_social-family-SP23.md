**Q** Which of the following must be true to explain the c-start excape response in fish in terms of evolutionary mechanisms? (**select all that apply**)  
a) In order for the snakes to catch them, the fish predated by tentacled snakes must have a less stereotyped c-start behavior than other fish (and are therefore less predictable)  
b) the fish must also have predators that cannot perform the j-shape predatory technique like tentacled snakes  
c) the fish predated by tentacled snakes must respond more slowly to startling stimuli  
d) the tentacled snake must gain a fitness benefit from the c-start escape behavior of the fish  

---

**Q** What aspect of reflexes and fixed action patterns makes it possible for “code breaking” behavior phenotypes to evolve(like the j-shape hunting technique of the tentacled snake)?  
Reflexes and fixed action patterns are (**choose the one correct answer**):  
a) stereotyped responses to specific stimuli  
b) learned  
c) maladaptive for the responding animal  
d) driven by neural mechanisms   
e) genetically inherited

**Figure ___ :** *Experimental conditions used to test whether birds use magnetic field or light polarization cues for navigation. A) In the normal (control) condition, both magnetic field (black) and light polarization (grey) cues were available to the birds that matched its normal environmental. The attempted migratory direction measured from birds in an Emlen Funnel (left) is shown with a dotted arrow. The birds were headed 90 degrees relative to the magnetic field and light polarization reference cues. B) In the experimentally manipulated condition, the magnetic field cue was oriented in the same direction as in A, but the polarization cue was oriented 90 degrees relative to its orientation in A.*

From [G-Santoya et al (2021) What doesn't kill you makes you stronger: Detoxification ability as a mechanism of honesty in a sexually selected signal](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.13798)

"Territorial animals often use signals, such as scent marks, colourful plumage and vocalizations, to advertise territory ownership (Bradbury & Vehrencamp, 2011). In theory, the same [signals] could also serve as indicators of territorial fighting ability that help individuals assess opponents and avoid unnecessary escalated fights."

---

**Q** A communication system in which a signal indicates fighting ability is a system that benefits
a) the sender
b) the receiver
c) both sender and receiver

---

"Deceit" is a phenotype that can disrupt an honest communication system. Consider the following game theory model of honesty and deceit. 

---

**Q** How does the "cost" of a signal 

---

**Q** Which of the following examples of evolutionary mechansims is most closely related to the conclusions of the damsel fly paper?

---

"Harmful byproducts of some metabolic pathways can reduce survival. However, rather than discarding these otherwise harmful byproducts, animals may use them as a signal. We tested this using the damselfly Hetaerina americana, where males bear a red wing spot (RWS) that has evolved by intrasexual competition."

**Q** Given the following game theory model that we studied in class, how can you explain the evolution of red wing spots as a communication signal in damsel flies?
*fighter, pacifist, assessor*

---

"Males with greater access to prey should develop proportionally larger wing spots, and be more likely to win
territorial fights after they reach maturity."

**Q** This could be a prediction of which following hypothesis?
a) handicap principle
b) attractiveness/runaway selection 
c) indicator principle
d) direct benefits

---

**Q** What would be a (testable) prediction of the hypothesis that this communication system evolved by the model of exploitation/"chase-away" selection?

**Figure 2** *Genetic basis of burrowing behavior. A) Burrowing behavior of two species of Peromyscus mice. P. polionotus dig more complex burrows than maniculatus. B) Scatterplot of the mean (circles) and standard deviation (diamonds) of burrow complexity measured in the parental generation of Peromyscus mice (both maniculatus and polionotus species). C) Scatterplot of the behavior of offspring (tested as adults) that were either cross-fostered or raised by their birth parents (not cross-fostered). The species label for the cross-fostered offspring refers to the species of the offspring themselves, not the parents that they were raised by.*

---

**Q** What would you conclude about the genetic basis of burrowing behavior from the results depicted in Figure 2B&C and why? (2-3 sentences).

--- 

Which of the following is a correlational (not causal) result from the research of Bendesky et al
(2017) that suggests a hormonal basis for parental care behavior: (highlight/circle ONE)
• QTL analysis revealed a region on chromosome 4 associated specifically with differences in nest
quality between species, but not other parental care behaviors.
• Injection of AVP (vasopressin) into mice specifically decreased nest quality.
• Functional genetics experiments revealed that species that made better quality nests had higher levels
of AVP (vasopressin) gene expression.

**Q** *(6 points)* You know from the literature that, in two species of *Peromyscus* mice (*polionotus* and *maniculatus*), burrowing behavior and parental care behavior are both heritable rather than learned. Now, you want to determine whether: 1) burrowing phenotypes are genetically linked to parental care phenotypes or 2) they are not genetically linked (ie. both are genetically ‘determined,’ but independently). Use what you know from studies we discussed during the course to describe one experiment that would provide results sufficient for distinguishing between (and therefore test) these two alternative hypotheses. Define (and describe) the metrics you would use to quantify each behavior. Describe the predicted experimental results that would be consistent with the hypothesis that mating and parental care behavior phenotypes are *not* genetically linked (again, you can include a plot of mock results if that helps you describe, but it must also be described in words). (You can - optionally - include a cartoon of the experimental design and/or results if that helps you describe, but it must also be described in words).

Few studies have directly addressed the combined effect of sexual and natural selection pressures. One example of such research comes from **the study of a communication system in the túngara frog**. 

Túngara frogs (*Engystomops pustulosus*) are a Neotropical species. At night, males produce special calls (vocalizations). Calls of male túngara frogs consist of a ***whine*** followed by up to seven ***chucks***. The whine is a long-frequency sweep, whereas the chuck is a shorter, louder, lower frequency stack. [In this audio clip, the wine is followed by one chuck](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2F441038a/MediaObjects/41586_2006_BF441038a_MOESM2_ESM.wav).

**Figure 2**: *A spectrogram of a male túngara frog mating call with the whine followed by three chucks. From Gridi-Papp et al[^Gridi-Papp]*

[^Gridi-Papp]: [Gridi-Papp, M., Rand, A. & Ryan, M. Complex call production in the túngara frog. Nature 441, 38 (2006).](https://doi.org/10.1038/441038a)

**Female frogs** select a mate based on the number of chucks in their call (Figure 3A). **Predators** (frog-eating bats, *Trachops cirrhosus*, and blood-sucking flies, *Corethrella spp.*) use the male túngara's call to target it for eating (Figure 3B).

**Figure 3**: *The number of chucks in a male's call is correlated with its attractiveness to potential female mates (A)* ***and*** *the ability of predators to find and attack it (B). These two factors would be included as selective pressures in an evolutionary model of this communication system.*

Compared to urban frogs, frogs in urban environments tend to have **fewer predators** (in urban environments, noise polution negatively impacts the fitness of túngara frogs less than its predators). 

---

**Q** *(2 points)*: Changes in the environment can change the impact of selective pressures (factors) in evolutionary models. In **an environment with a more reproductively available females**, **which of the following would be true** (in the context of an evolutionary model for male calling behavior)?  
(***Chose the correct answer***)   
**a)** The fitness change due to mating success would increase.  
**b)** The fitness change due to mating success would decrease. 
**c)** The fitness change due to predation risk would increase.  
**d)** The fitness change due to predation risk would decrease.  

---

**Q** *(3 points)*: Therefore, **you would predict that**:  
(***Choose the correct answer*** and ***explain your reasoning***.)    
**a)** There would be no change in male túngara calling behavior.  
**b)** Rural túngara calls would evolve to have more chucks.  
**c)** Rural túngara calls would evolve to have fewer chucks.  

---

**Q** *(2 points)*: If male calling behavior was under sexual selection pressure by the handicap principle, then in urban environments you would predict that:  
**a)** There would be no change in calling behavior.  
**b)** The male calls would evolve to have more chucks.  
**c)** The male calls would evolve to have fewer chucks. [this one because without predators, an increased number of chucks is not negatively impacting its fitness... so there would be no reason to expend that energy on chucks because it would not be a signal to females of fitness.... BUT the energy expenditure might be enough to maintain it as a sign of handicap?)   

---

**Q** *(2 points)*: If male calling behavior was shaped by pre-existing sensory bias, then in urban environments you would predict that: 
**a)** There would be no change in calling behavior.  
**b)** The male calls would evolve to have more chucks.  [this one because the females are attracted to the chucks and males have exploited this... without predators, they would push that exploitation even more]  
**c)** The male calls would evolve to have fewer chucks.

The frogs' ear has two different organs that transduce (transform) sound into neural signals (spikes): the amphibian papilla and the **basilar papilla**. The basilar papilla is the part of the ear in the female túngara that is responsible for their behavioral mating response to the male túngara call. The basilar papilla in the female túngara's ear is selectively sensitive to (responds with a high spike rate to) the **chuck** of the male call (but not to the whine).

**Figure 4**: *Phylogeny of the set of species most closely related to the túngara frog (E. pustulosus). Across this phylogeny, two traits have been mapped: the* ***sensory sensitivity*** *of the female basilar papilla to the chuck, and the* ***existence of chucks*** *after the whine in the male call. For example, E. postulosus females have a basilar papilla that is sensitive to the male chuck and the call of male E. postulosus contains chucks. And, as another example, the basilar papilla of E. pustulatus females is not sensitive to chucks and the call of male E. pustulatus lack chucks (contain only the whine).*

**Q** *(2 points)*: Is the data shown in Figure 4 more consistent with the hypothesis that the communication system between male and female frogs evolved based on "chase-away" or "runaway" sexual selection? ***Explain your reasoning***.

**Q** Under a handicap principle:  
a) Mates would exert selective pressure for the call to stay the same  
b) mates would exert selective pressure for the call to change so that it avoids attracting predators   

---

**Q** Under the good genes hypothesis:  
a) Mates would exert selective pressure for the call to stay the same  
b) mates would exert selective pressure for the call to change so that it avoids attracting predators   

<!-- One way male túngara frogs solve this problem is by facultatively varying the complexity of their calls. When they are alone they produce mostly simple calls; when they are in choruses, they produce calls with chucks. -->
