**Q** Which of the following must be true to explain the c-start excape response in fish in terms of evolutionary mechanisms? (**select all that apply**)  
a) In order for the snakes to catch them, the fish predated by tentacled snakes must have a less stereotyped c-start behavior than other fish (and are therefore less predictable)  
b) the fish must also have predators that cannot perform the j-shape predatory technique like tentacled snakes  
c) the fish predated by tentacled snakes must respond more slowly to startling stimuli  
d) the tentacled snake must gain a fitness benefit from the c-start escape behavior of the fish  

**Q** What aspect of reflexes and fixed action patterns makes it possible for animals to evolve “code breaking” behaviors (like the j-shape hunting technique of the tentacled snake)?  
Reflexes and fixed action patterns are (**choose the one correct answer**):  
a) stereotyped responses to specific stimuli  
b) learned  
c) maladaptive for the responding animal  
d) driven by neural mechanisms   
e) genetically inherited

**Q** To obtain information about ___________________ during navigation, ants keep track of their
__________________ (Witlinger et al 2007). Therefore, if you ____________________ the length of their
_________________, the ants will overestimate this value.

**Figure ___ :** *Experimental conditions used to test whether birds use magnetic field or light polarization cues for navigation. A) In the normal (control) condition, both magnetic field (black) and light polarization (grey) cues were available to the birds that matched its normal environmental. The attempted migratory direction measured from birds in an Emlen Funnel (left) is shown with a dotted arrow. The birds were headed 90 degrees relative to the magnetic field and light polarization reference cues. B) In the experimentally manipulated condition, the magnetic field cue was oriented in the same direction as in A, but the polarization cue was oriented 90 degrees relative to its orientation in A.*

**Q** Draw the predicted migratory direction that a bird would try to embark on if the experimental manipulation in B was performed and the bird uses only magnetic field cues (make sure the drawn direction is clear relative to the directions in Figure ___ A and B).

**Q** Draw the predicted migratory direction that a bird would try to embark on if the experimental manipulation in B was performed and the bird uses only magnetic field cues (make sure the drawn direction is clear relative to the directions in Figure ___ A and B).


**Q** From the results of this experient, you would be able to conclude whether migratory behaivor is genetically inherited or learned in these birds?  
**TRUE/FALSE**

From [G-Santoya et al (2021) What doesn't kill you makes you stronger: Detoxification ability as a mechanism of honesty in a sexually selected signal](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.13798)

"Territorial animals often use signals, such as scent marks, colourful plumage and vocalizations, to advertise territory ownership (Bradbury & Vehrencamp, 2011). In theory, the same [signals] could also serve as indicators of territorial fighting ability that help individuals assess opponents and avoid unnecessary escalated fights."

**Q** A communication system in which a signal indicates fighting ability is a system that benefits
a) the sender
b) the receiver
c) both sender and receiver

"Deceit" is a phenotype that can disrupt an honest communication system. Consider the following game theory model of honesty and deceit. 

**Q** How does the "cost" of a signal 

**Q** Which of the following examples of evolutionary mechansims is most closely related to the conclusions of the damsel fly paper?

"Harmful byproducts of some metabolic pathways can reduce survival. However, rather than discarding these otherwise harmful byproducts, animals may use them as a signal. We tested this using the damselfly Hetaerina americana, where males bear a red wing spot (RWS) that has evolved by intrasexual competition."

**Q** Given the following game theory model that we studied in class, how can you explain the evolution of red wing spots as a communication signal in damsel flies?
*fighter, pacifist, assessor*

"Males with greater access to prey should develop proportionally larger wing spots, and be more likely to win
territorial fights after they reach maturity."

**Q** This could be a prediction of which following hypothesis?
a) handicap principle
b) attractiveness/runaway selection 
c) indicator principle
d) direct benefits

**Q** What would be a (testable) prediction of the hypothesis that this communication system evolved by the model of exploitation/"chase-away" selection?
