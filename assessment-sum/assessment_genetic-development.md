Burrowing behavior and parental care behavior have both diverged significantly between two interfertile sister species, P. maniculatus and P. polionotus., for which forward genetic approaches combined with high-throughput genotyping in Peromyscus have been successful in identifying the genetic architecture of complex behavior. 

Example: data distributions from bendesky 2017

show behavioral phenotypes of manic and polio

show genetic cross experiment... task to explain the experimental design, the two alternate hypotheses, and prediction of results given each hypothesis (given data on manic and polio phenotypes).

show correlation of behavioral components in hibrid generation... task to infer most consistent QTL results (chromosome regions explaining phenoptype variation) based on the correlation data
