Burrowing behavior and parental care behavior have both diverged significantly between two interfertile sister species, P. maniculatus and P. polionotus., for which forward genetic approaches combined with high-throughput genotyping in Peromyscus have been successful in identifying the genetic architecture of complex behavior. 

Example: data distributions from bendesky 2017

show behavioral phenotypes of manic and polio

show genetic cross experiment... task to explain the experimental design, the two alternate hypotheses, and prediction of results given each hypothesis (given data on manic and polio phenotypes).

show correlation of behavioral components in hibrid generation... task to infer most consistent QTL results (chromosome regions explaining phenoptype variation) based on the correlation data 


## Section 2: Nurses and Foragers

Honey bee workers exhibit strong and stable differences in behavior between individuals. Behavioral differences arise as part of a system of age-related, socially regulated division of labor common to species of social insects. Bees perform several different tasks in the hive during the first 2 to 3 weeks of adult life, including brood care (“nursing”), and then shift to foraging for nectar and pollen outside the hive for the remainder of their 5- to 7-week life. The timing of the transition from hive work to foraging is also variable and may be accelerated, delayed, or reversed depending on the needs of the colony. These changes in role are associated with changes in brain structure and neurochemistry.

Individual brain gene expression profiles predict behavioral phenotype between young nurses (YN) and old foragers (OF) from typical bee colonies and experimental colonies.  Expression levels (measured as messenger RNA abundance) are indicated by color scale in which expression ratio (F/N) is average for all foragers and nurses (n = 30 per group). In the absence of old bees, some individuals initiate foraging as much as 2 weeks earlier than usual (*young forager* single cohort). If there are more foragers in the population than normal, some nurses will delay the developmental transition. Individual brain gene expression profiles are shown for age-matched young nurses and young (“precocious”) foragers, and age-matched old foragers and old (“overage”) nurses. Further experiments should help to determine which genes are responding to environmental cues known to be important regulators of behavior, and which genes and pathways cause changes in behavior.

Because foragers are older than nurses in a typical population, examination of bees from typical colonies did not reveal whether gene expression differences are associated with behavior or with age.
