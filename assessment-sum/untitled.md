Bechard and Mason (2010) were the first to research the natural independence of lab mice. To do this, they used a novel housing system that allowed young lab mice to choose between spending time
in the home cage (HC) with the mother, or an identical distant cage (a ‘dispersal cage’: DC) which the mother could not access. Their objective was to determine the age at which young lab mice prefer to spend time in a distant cage not containing their mother. To do so, they used the ethogram shown in Table 1 and live observation techniques (rather than video recording).

***Q:*** In this study, they needed to calculate the activity budget of pups (*developing* mice), but not the action transition matrix. Therefore, they could implement [choose an option from below], which they would not have been able to do if they needed to calculate transition matrices. 
- continuous scan sampling
- continuous focal sampling
- interval focal sampling
- interval scan sampling

***Q:*** However, they were also interested in comparing how the parental care behavior of wild mouse mothers compared to lab mouse mothers. They wanted to compare both the activity budget and the action sequencing of mothers. Therefore, they needed to implement [choose an option from below] to record the behavioral data for mother mice.
- continuous scan sampling
- continuous focal sampling
- interval sampling

Mouse families (a mother and its litter of pups) were directly observed daily under dim red light from when pups were day 16 of age until day 35. Each day, the behavior observation period spanned the initial 2 h of the active (dark) period. Each family was observed once every 10 min, for a total of 12 observations per day, and final scores calculated as a daily percentage of observations. Behaviours were identified using a mixture of scan and focal sampling: a family was scanned initially to identify the mouse of interest (e.g. dam), followed by focal instantaneous observation of that individual. The HC was watched for the behaviours described in Table 1. Dam presence on pups was measured when the dam was the focal animal, and analysed together with nursing and pup licking/grooming as one measure termed ‘dam on pups’. The dam was scored as on top of her pups even if some of the pups were active outside of the nest. The activity and location of the entire litter were additionally recorded as a percentage of pups per cage. Mice spend the majority of time inactive, and so the place of rest is suggested to be the ‘preferred location’ (Blom et al., 1992) of a healthy animal. We therefore also assessed the amount of time pups spent inactive in the DC relative to the total amount of time spent inactive, as a measure of preference for the environment.
