Zahavi studied the Arabian babbler, a very social bird, with a life-length of 30 years, which was considered to have altruistic behaviors. The helping-at-the-nest behavior often occurs among unrelated individuals, and therefore cannot be explained by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to the handicap principle. 

***Q:*** How does the following game theory model (standard altruist and selfish) predict that altruism would not be evolutionarily stable?*** 

***Q:*** How does taking into account sexual selection change the model? 
- The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve its attractiveness to potential mates. The evolution of this condition may be explained by competitive altruism.
