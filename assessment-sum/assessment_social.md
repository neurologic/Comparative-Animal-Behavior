**Case Study: Social behavior in Bathyergidae**

There are, broadly, several majore categories of social behavior: solitary, social, and eusocial

:::{glossary}

solitary
	Individuals live and behave alone (except during mating usually)

social
	Individuals group together for some activities, but each maintain reproductive independence. 

eusocial
	Some individuals among the social group give up their own reproductive opportunities to help others reproduce.

Check out the [phylogeny of Bathyergidae on OpenTree](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/opentree13.4@mrcaott45520ott692678/Bathyergidae--Petromuridae). 

Bathyergidae is comprised of 6 Genera: *Heterocephalus, Bathyergus, Fukomys, Cryptomys, Georychus,* and *Heliophobius*. There are only two species among the Bathyergidae family that are eusocial: *Fukomys demarensis* and *Heterocephalus glaber*. 

***Q: How many extant species are within the Bathyergidae family?***

If all extent species from the heliophobius genus are not eusocial, then it is more likely that the LCA of all heliophobius was not eusocial. The same logic applies to Bathyergus, Cryptomys, and Georychus. Likewise, the LCA of all Fukomys was likely not eusocial. To construct the behavior of the LCA for all Bathyergidae, We can consider a 'reduced' tree of all genera within this family.

***Q: Why is the Heterocephalus genus LCA eusocial?***

***Q: Which hypothesis would you reject based on parsimony?***

*Outgroups* can help resolve ambiguity in ancestral state reconstruction.

***Q: Both Petromuridae and Thryonomyidae were* not *eusocial, what would you conclude about the behavior of the LCA for Bathyergidae?***

***Q: What was the most likely behavior of the LCA for all Bathyergidae species - based on counts of evolutionary change under each alternate hypothesis and a model of parsimony?***

***Q: Why is it important to include outgroups in an ancestral state reconstruction?***
