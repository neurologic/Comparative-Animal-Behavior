:::{admonition} Honor Code
This exam is open note/book/web, but must be done independently. Do not consult any other people (regardless of whether they are in or out of this course) in answering the questions. Handing in responses to assignment for grading serves as your signature of the honor code.
:::

Answer all questions either electronically or by hand. Label each of your answers with the corresponding question number (Q - Q). Scan or convert your document to a good quality PDF. Upload to gradescope by the deadline. 

***Please don't hesitate to ask for clarifation on the wording of questions and/or expectations.*** Key expectations are highlighted with font style. For any multiple choice question that asks for an explanation of your reasoning: I am looking for a correct answer selection as well as reasoning for selecting that answer - the reasoning should logically (and unabiguously) explain for your answer selection. Not all multiple choice questions require for reasoning.


## Section 1

**Q (4 points; \~7 minutes)**: In a species where the operational sex ratio was female-biased (more reproductively available females than males), sexual selecton pressures would need to be included in evolutionary models of behavior for [ **males / females** ] more often than for [ **males / females** ]. **And WHY?**  
(***Choose the best answer in each bracket and then explain the reason why that answer set is correct***).

Forsgren et al (2004)[^forsgren-2004] found that, in wild populations of two-spotted gobys (a fish), the operational sex ratio changed throughout the mating season (Figure 1).

**Figure 1** *(From Forsgren et al 2004[^forsgren-2004]) Over the mating season, there is a large (tenfold) decline in the number of males, whereas female numbers do not vary significantly and more females become ready to mate as males die off (males have a higher mortality rate during breeding season). This results in a changing operational sex ratio. When there are equal numbers of reproductively available males and females, the operational sex ratio = 0.5 (50% males to 50% females).* 

As you know, intrasexual competition over mates and courtship displays (such as dancing) are two of the most common behaviors resulting from sexual selection pressures.

**Q (4 points; \~7 minutes)**: Which of the following would you predict based on the results shows in Figure 1? **And WHY?**   
(***Choose the best answer and then explain your reasoning***.)  
**a)** The population would be sexually dimorphic in courtship display behavior, with males performing more mating displays than females.  
**b)** The population would be sexually dimorphic in courtship display behavior, with females performing more mating displays than males.   
**c)** There would be no sex differences in courtship display behavior, because neither sex is mate-limited.  
**d)** The population would be sexually dimorphic in courtship display behavior. Early in the season, males would perform courtship displays toward females; while late in the season, females would perform courtship displays toward males.

## Section 2

Amotz Zahavi studied the Arabian babbler, a very social bird that nests communally in mixed-sex groups and lives \~30 years. Male babblers seem to exhibit altruism through a "*helping-at-the-nest*" behavior. During the breeding season, individual males help feed and care for *all* of the young in the communal nest including their own, which means that helping-at-the-nest behavior likely occurs among unrelated individuals. Therefore, kin selection models may not be sufficient to provide an evolutionary explaination for the behavior. 

---

**Q (3 points; \~7 minutes)**: How does the standard evolutionary model of altruism (shown below) predict that altruism cannot be evolutionarily stable?  
(With your explanation, ***show all of your work***.)  

:::{admonition} An basic evolutionary model of altruism
  1. When altruists interact, they exchange the cost (c) and benefit (b) of altruism
  2. When altruists interact with selfish individuals, the altruist pays the cost and the selfish individual receives the benefit
  3. When selfish individuals interact, they receive no benefit but expend no cost. 

  | |Altruist |Selfish|
  |:--: |:--:|:--:
  |**Altruist**| $(b - c) / 2$ | $-c$ |
  |**Selfish**| $b$ | $0$ |
:::

Zahavi proposed reinterpreting helping-at-the-nest behavior according to the principles of sexual selection. His hypothesis was that the altruistic males, by helping raise young that are not their own, signal to females that they are sooooo physiologically robust that they can afford to take care other males' offspring in addition to their own (ie. the *handicap principle*). This altruistic act could therefore increase their *mating success in the next breeding season*, which is a factor that Zahavi included in the standard model of altruism as "***$m$***". For example, when an altruist is in the context of a selfish individual, the altruist would lose fitness due to the energetic costs of feeding more young ($-c$) without ever receiving a reciprocal benefit ($+b$) from the selfish individual (their own young getting fed extra). However, the altruist would have signaled its robustness to females and increased its mating probability ($+m$). *The payoff for altruists in the context of selfish would therefore be $m - c$*.

**Q (2 points; \~5 minutes)**: Which is the correct revision of the payoff for altruists in the context of altruists?  
(***Chose the correct answer***)  
**a)** $(m - c)/2$  
**b)** $(b - c + m)/2$  
**c)** $m$ 

---

**Q (2 points; \~5 minutes)**: Does taking into account sexual selection (as was proposed by Zahavi) change the predicted outcome of the model?  
(***Chose the correct answer and then fill in the blank with the appropriate inequality(ies) from solving the model***. No need to show your work, but you can).  
**a)** Yes, altruism would now be evolutionarily stable when [ ______ ].   
**b)** No, altruism can still never be evolutionarily stable because [ ______ ].

## Section 3
 
**Q (6 points; \~20 minutes)**: You know from the literature that, in two species of *Peromyscus* mice (*polionotus* and *maniculatus*), **mating** behavior and **parental care** behavior are both heritable rather than learned. Now, you want to ***determine whether mating phenotypes are genetically linked to parental care phenotypes***. Use what you know from studies we discussed during the course to ***briefly outline one experiment*** that would enable you to **distinguish between (and therefore test) the two alternative hypotheses**: **1)** that mating behavior and parental care are genetically linked, and **2)** that mating behavior and parental care are not genetically linked (ie. both are genetically ‘determined,’ but independently). ***Make sure to explain the metrics you would use to quantify each behavior***. You can include a cartoon of the experimental design and your comparisons if that helps you describe. ***Draw a plot/table of the predicted experimental results that would be consistent with the hypothesis that mating and parental care behavior phenotypes are genetically linked*** (label your plot well).   
(***In summary: explain your experiment, including the metrics used to quantify each behavior, and then draw a plot of the results predicted if the two are genetically linked***.)

## Section 4

**Q (6 points; \~20 minutes)**: Male frog calling...

Predators would exert selective pressure for the sound to: change in a particular way (versus other options)

Under a handicap principle, Mates would exert selective pressure for the call to stay the same

Under the good genes hypothesis, mates would exert selectiv pressure for the call to change so that it avoids attracting predators

If evolved based on pre-existing sensory bias, would you predict that the call was more constrained by sexual selection to stay the same even though predators?
