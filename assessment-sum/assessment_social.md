## Section 1

(*This section should take ~20 min total*)

**Q1 (4 points; \~7 minutes)**: In a species where the **operational sex ratio was female-biased** (more reproductively available females than males), sexual selection pressures (for example, the need to obtain a mate) would need to be included in evolutionary models of behavior for [ **males / females** ] *more often than for* [ **males / females** ]. **And WHY?**  
(***Choose the best answer in each bracket and then explain the reason why that answer set is correct***). 

---

Forsgren et al (2004)[^forsgren-2004] found that, in wild populations of two-spotted gobys (a fish), the operational sex ratio changed throughout the mating season (Figure 1).

**Figure 1** *(From Forsgren et al 2004[^forsgren-2004]) Over the mating season, there is a large (tenfold) decline in the number of males, whereas female numbers do not vary significantly and more females become ready to mate as males die off (males have a higher mortality rate during breeding season). This results in a changing operational sex ratio. When there are equal numbers of reproductively available males and females, the operational sex ratio = 0.5 (50% males to 50% females).* 

As you know, courtship displays (ie. "mating displays," such as dancing) are a common behavior that evolve due to sexual selection pressures. 

---

**Q2 (4 points; \~7 minutes)**: Which of the following would you predict based on the results shows in Figure 1? **And WHY?**   
(***Choose the best answer*** and ***explain your reasoning***.)  
**a)** The population would be sexually dimorphic in courtship display behavior, with males performing more mating displays than females.  
**b)** The population would be sexually dimorphic in courtship display behavior, with females performing more mating displays than males.   
**c)** There would be no sex differences in courtship display behavior, because neither sex is mate-limited.  
**d)** The population would be sexually dimorphic in courtship display behavior. Early in the season, males would perform courtship displays toward females; while late in the season, females would perform courtship displays toward males.

## Section 2

(*This section should take ~30 min total: ~10 minutes of background information; ~20 min questions*)

Amotz Zahavi studied the Arabian babbler, a very social bird that nests communally in mixed-sex groups and lives \~30 years. Male babblers seem to exhibit altruism through a "*helping-at-the-nest*" behavior. During the breeding season, individual males help feed and care for *all* of the young in the communal nest including their own, which means that helping-at-the-nest behavior likely occurs among *unrelated* individuals. Therefore, kin selection models may not be sufficient to provide an evolutionary explanation for the behavior. 

---

**Q3 (3 points; \~7 minutes)**: How does the standard evolutionary model of altruism (shown below) predict that altruism cannot be evolutionarily stable?  
(Along with your ***explanation*** in sentence format, ***show all of your work*** mathematically.)  

:::{admonition} A basic evolutionary model of altruism
  1. When altruists interact, they exchange the cost ($c$) and benefit ($b$) of altruism
  2. When altruists interact with selfish individuals, the altruist pays the cost and the selfish individual receives the benefit
  3. When selfish individuals interact, they receive no benefit but expend no cost. 

  | |Altruist |Selfish|
  |:--: |:--:|:--:
  |**Altruist**| $(b - c) / 2$ | $-c$ |
  |**Selfish**| $b$ | $0$ |
:::

---

Zahavi proposed reinterpreting helping-at-the-nest behavior according to the principles of **sexual selection**. His hypothesis was that the altruistic males, by helping raise young that are not their own, signal to females that they are sooooo physiologically robust that they can afford to take care other males' offspring in addition to their own (ie. the *handicap principle*). This altruistic act could therefore increase their *mating success in the next breeding season*, which is a factor that Zahavi included in the standard model of altruism as the factor "***$m$***". For example, when an altruist is in the context of a selfish individual, the altruist would lose fitness due to the energetic costs of feeding more young ($-c$) without ever receiving a reciprocal benefit ($+b$) from the selfish individual (their own young getting fed extra). However, the altruist would have signaled its robustness to females and increased its mating probability ($+m$) for the next season. *The net payoff for altruist in the context of selfish would therefore be $m - c$* (**see below**).

:::{admonition} Zahavi's revised model of altruism (the same model we discussed in class)

  | |Altruist |Selfish|
  |:--: |:--:|:--:
  |**Altruist**| ? | $m - c$ |
  |**Selfish**| $b$ | $0$ |

---

**Q4 (2 points; \~5 minutes)**: Which is the correct revision of the payoff for altruists in the context of altruists based on Zahavi's hypothesis?  
(***Choose the correct answer***)  
**a)** $(m - c)/2$  
**b)** $(b - c + m)/2$  
**c)** $m$ 

---

**Q5 (2 points; \~5 minutes)**: Does taking into account sexual selection (as was proposed by Zahavi) change the predicted outcome of the model?  
(***Choose the correct answer*** and then ***fill in the blank with the appropriate inequality(ies) from solving the revised model***. No need to show your work, but you can if you want).  
**a)** Yes, altruism would now be evolutionarily stable when [ ______ ].   
**b)** No, altruism can still never be evolutionarily stable because [ ______ ].

## Section 3

(*This section should take ~15 min total*)

**Q6 (6 points; \~15 minutes)**: You know from the literature that, in two species of *Peromyscus* mice (*polionotus* and *maniculatus*), **mating** behavior and **parental care** behavior are both heritable rather than learned. Now, you want to **determine whether mating phenotypes are genetically linked to parental care phenotypes**. Use what you know from studies we discussed during the course to ***briefly outline one experiment*** that would enable you to **distinguish between (and therefore test) the two alternative hypotheses**: **1)** that mating behavior and parental care are genetically linked, and **2)** that mating behavior and parental care are not genetically linked (ie. both are genetically ‘determined,’ but independently). ***Make sure to explain the metrics you would use to quantify each behavior***. You can include a cartoon of the experimental design and your comparisons if that helps you describe, but it must be described in words. ***Draw a plot of the predicted experimental results that would be consistent with the hypothesis that mating and parental care behavior phenotypes are genetically linked*** (label your plot well).   
(**In summary**: ***explain a sufficient experiment, including a descriptions the metrics used to quantify behavior in the experiment, and draw a plot of the results predicted if the two are genetically linked***.)

## Section 4

(*This section should take ~30 min total: ~10 minutes of background information; ~20 min questions*)

Few studies have directly addressed the combined effect of sexual and natural selection pressures. One example of such research comes from **the study of a communication system in the túngara frog**. 

Túngara frogs (*Engystomops pustulosus*) are a Neotropical species. At night, males produce special calls (vocalizations). Calls of male túngara frogs consist of a ***whine*** followed by up to seven ***chucks***. The whine is a long-frequency sweep, whereas the chuck is a shorter, louder, lower frequency stack. [In this audio clip, the wine is followed by one chuck](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2F441038a/MediaObjects/41586_2006_BF441038a_MOESM2_ESM.wav).

**Figure 2**: *A spectrogram of a male túngara frog mating call with the whine followed by three chucks. From Gridi-Papp et al[^Gridi-Papp]*

**Female frogs** use the male's call to target the male for mating (see Figure 3). **Predators** (frog-eating bats, *Trachops cirrhosus*, and blood-sucking flies, *Corethrella spp.*) use the male túngara's call to target it for eating (see Figure 3).

**Figure 3**: *The number of chucks in a male's call is correlated with its attractiveness to potential female mates (A)* ***and*** *the ability of predators to find and attack it (B).*

---

**Q7 (2 points; \~3 minutes)**: If you constructed an evolutionary model of male túngara calling behavior that included both of the selective pressures tested in Figure 3 as factors, ***which factor would increase net (total) fitness*** (ie. be added in the model equation) **and** ***which factor would decrease net fitness*** (ie. be subtracted in the model equation)?   

---

**Q8 (2 points; \~3 minutes)**: Changes in the environment can change the value (magnitude) of factors (selective pressures) in evolutionary models. In **an environment with fewer predators**, **which of the following would be true** (in the context of an evolutionary model for male calling behavior)?  
(***Chose the correct answer***)   
**a)** The fitness change due to mating success would increase.  
**b)** The net fitness of the male would increase.  
**c)** The fitness change due to predation risk would increase.  

---

**Q9 (3 points; \~7 minutes)**: In urban environments, túngara frogs have **fewer predators** (noise polution negatively impacts the fitness of túngara frogs less than its predators). Therefore, **you would predict that**:  
(***Choose the correct answer*** and ***explain your reasoning***.)    
**a)** There would be no change in male túngara calling behavior.  
**b)** The male túngara calls would evolve to have more chucks.  
**c)** The male túngara calls would evolve to have fewer chucks.  

---

The frogs' ear has two different organs that transduce (transform) sound into neural signals (spikes): the amphibian papilla and the **basilar papilla**. The basilar papilla is the part of the ear in the female túngara that is responsible for their behavioral mating response to the male túngara call. The basilar papilla in the female túngara's ear is selectively sensitive to (responds with a high spike rate to) the **chuck** of the male call (but not to the whine). 

---

**Q10 (3 points; \~7 minutes)**: Is the data shown in Figure 4 (below) more consistent with the hypothesis that this communication system evolved based on "**sensory bias**" or with the hypothesis that this communication system evolved based on "**pre-existing traits**"? ***Explain your reasoning***.

:::

**Figure 4**: *Phylogeny of the set of species most closely related to the túngara frog (E. pustulosus). Across this phylogeny, two traits have been mapped: the* ***sensory sensitivity*** *of the female basilar papilla to the chuck, and the* ***existence of chucks*** *after the whine in the male call. For example, E. postulosus females have a basilar papilla that is sensitive to the male chuck and the call of male E. postulosus contains chucks. And, as another example, the basilar papilla of E. pustulatus females is not sensitive to chucks and the call of male E. pustulatus lack chucks (contain only the whine).*

<!-- **Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: If male calling behavior was under sexual selection pressure by the handicap principle, then in urban environments you would predict that: 
**a)** There would be no change in calling behavior.  
**b)** The male calls would evolve to have more chucks.  
**c)** The male calls would evolve to have fewer chucks. [this one because without predators, an increased number of chucks is not negatively impacting its fitness... so there would be no reason to expend that energy on chucks because it would not be a signal to females of fitness.... BUT the energy expenditure might be enough to maintain it as a sign of handicap?)   

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: If male calling behavior was shaped by pre-existing sensory bias, then in urban environments you would predict that: 
**a)** There would be no change in calling behavior.  
**b)** The male calls would evolve to have more chucks.  [this one because the females are attracted to the chucks and males have exploited this... without predators, they would push that exploitation even more]  
**c)** The male calls would evolve to have fewer chucks.

<!--  
Under a handicap principle, Mates would exert selective pressure for the call to stay the same

Under the good genes hypothesis, mates would exert selectiv pressure for the call to change so that it avoids attracting predators -->

<!-- One way male túngara frogs solve this problem is by facultatively varying the complexity of their calls. When they are alone they produce mostly simple calls; when they are in choruses, they produce calls with chucks. -->
