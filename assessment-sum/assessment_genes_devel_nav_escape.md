## Section 1

[^oliva-2022]: [Oliva et al (2022) Characterizing the genetic basis of trait evolution in the Mexican cavefish. Evol Dev. 2022 Sep;24(5):131-144.](https://doi.org/10.1111/ede.12412)

The Mexican tetra, *Astyanax mexicanus*, consists of a population of fish that inhabit caves in Northeast Mexico, and a surface fish population, that inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. In response to their different environments, these two populations have evolved different behavioral traits. Critically, these two independent populations can breed with each other and produce viable offspring (ie. they are interfertile populations). 

Recently, purebred populations of cave and surface fish were tested for behavioral differences in locomotor activity, escape reflex movement, and prey capture. Each behavior was quantified by two traits that were then measured. For example, prey capture behavior was quantified by the strike angle and the strike distance (Figure 1).

**Q1 (3 points; \~ minutes)**: **Refer to Figure 1** ***Describe an experiment*** that would enable you to determine whether prey capture behavior in each of these independent populations (surface and cave fish) is genetically inherited or learned from their parents. Summarize in words the predicted results under each hypothesis. Make a ***plot of the results you would predict*** if prey capture behavior was ***genetically inherited***. Make a ***plot the results you would predict*** if prey capture behavior was ***learned***. (*Just plot the predicted median trait values. Make sure to label your axes.*).

After quantifying the behavioral traits of cave and surface fish, the researchers performed a genetic cross experiment (Figure 2). The **F2** population was then assessed by the same behavioral metrics that the parental populations were assessed by (Figure 3). The specifics of the behavioral trait metrics are not important, but knowing the names of the metrics will help you interpret Figure 4. *Escape* behavior was quantified by the body's ***peak angle*** during the c-shape phase of the c-start escape and by the ***angular velocity*** from the start of the c-shape to the time the body was at its peak angle. *Prey capture* behavior was quantified by the ***strike angle*** and the ***strike distance***. *Locomotion* behavior was quantified by the ***time in the center*** of the arena and the ***total distance*** moved during the test.

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: From the results shown in Figure 4, the researchers could infer that: 
a) The genes for the escape behavior traits are linked to the genes for all other behavioral triats tested.    
b) The genes for the escape behavior traits are more likely to recombine during chromosome crossover events than the genes for the other traits. 
c) The genes for locomotion behavior are likely on different chromosomes than the genes for prey capture behavior.

## Section 2: Nurses and Foragers

Honey bee workers exhibit strong and stable differences in behavior between individuals. Behavioral differences arise as part of a system of age-related, socially regulated division of labor common to species of social insects. During the first 2-3 weeks of adult life, bees exhibit the ***nurse*** phenotype and perform several different tasks in the hive, including brood care. After 3 weeks a bee will generally shift to the ***forager*** phenotype and leave the hive in search of nectar and pollen. The timing of the transition from hive work to foraging is also variable and may be accelerated, delayed, or reversed depending on the needs of the colony. These changes in role are associated with changes in brain structure and neurochemistry.

**Figure 5**: Individual brain gene expression profiles predict behavioral phenotype between young nurses (YN) and old foragers (OF) from typical bee colonies and experimental colonies.  Expression levels (measured as messenger RNA abundance) are indicated by color scale in which expression ratio (F/N) is average for all foragers and nurses (n = 30 per group). In the absence of old bees, some individuals initiate foraging as much as 2 weeks earlier than usual (*young forager* single cohort). If there are more foragers in the population than normal, some nurses will delay the developmental transition. Individual brain gene expression profiles are shown for age-matched young nurses and young (“precocious”) foragers, and age-matched old foragers and old (“overage”) nurses. Further experiments should help to determine which genes are responding to environmental cues known to be important regulators of behavior, and which genes and pathways cause changes in behavior.[^WHITFIELD2003]

Because foragers are older than nurses in a typical population, examination of bees from typical colonies did not reveal whether gene expression differences are associated with behavior or with age.

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: ***Select one of the following choices***:  
a) Nurse and forager phenotypes in bees are an example of a polyphenism because all bees have both nurse and forager genes/alleles (as shown in Figure 5).
b) Nurse and forager phenotypes in bees are an example of a polymorphism because nurses and foragers must have different morphological features to do these different jobs.  
c) Nurse and forager phenotypes in bees are an example of a polyphenism because nurses and foragers have different genes/alleles responsible for their social behavior (as shown in Figure 5).

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: ***Select one of the following choices***:  
a) young bees are usually nurses, but can become foragers if the forager genes are expressed.
b) differences in the

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: Which is a selective pressure that maintains c-start behavior in fish?  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)  
a) the need to escape from predators  
b) the speed with which a c-start escape can be accomplished  
c) the need to navigate toward food sources  
d) the predictability of the FAP motor pattern  

---

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: What are the neural mechanisms that make the c-start effective as an anti-predator strategy?  
(***Choose all options that are correct*** from the list below. You may choose more than one. You will receive one point off for choosing any that are incorrect)    
a) the Mauthner cell has a large diameter axon   
b) inhibition of the motor neurons on the same side of the body as the activated Mauthner cell  
c) inhibition of the motor neurons on the opposite side of the body as the activated Mauthner cell  
d) Mauthner cell input from sensory filters sensitive to the movement of predators  
e) Mauthner cell input from sensory filters that are activated by all movement in the water

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: What must be true for c-start escape to exist in fish predated by tentacled snakes?  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)  
a) the fish predated by tentacled snakes have a less stereotyped c-start behavior (and are therefore less predictable)  
b) the fish have other predators  
c) the fish predated by tentacled snakes respond more slowly to startling stimuli

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: How would you test whether tentacled snake code-breaking is learned through experience or genetically inherited? (It is ok if your proposed experiment has already been done in real life)
