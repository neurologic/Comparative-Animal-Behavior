:::{admonition} Honor Code
This exam is open note/book/web, but must be done independently. Do not consult any other people (regardless of whether they are in or out of this course) in answering the questions. Handing in responses to assignment for grading serves as your signature of the honor code.
:::

Answer all questions either electronically or by hand. Label each of your answers with the corresponding question number (Q1 - Q10). Scan or convert your document to a good quality PDF. Upload to gradescope by the deadline. 

***Please don't hesitate to ask for clarifation on the wording of questions and/or expectations.*** Key expectations are highlighted with font style. For any multiple choice question that asks for an explanation of your reasoning: I am looking for a correct answer selection as well as reasoning for selecting that answer - the reasoning should logically (and unabiguously) explain for your answer selection. Not all multiple choice questions require for reasoning.

## Section 1

Burrowing behavior and parental care behavior have both diverged significantly between two interfertile sister species, P. maniculatus and P. polionotus., for which forward genetic approaches combined with high-throughput genotyping in Peromyscus have been successful in identifying the genetic architecture of complex behavior. 

Example: data distributions from bendesky 2017

show behavioral phenotypes of manic and polio

show genetic cross experiment... task to explain the experimental design, the two alternate hypotheses, and prediction of results given each hypothesis (given data on manic and polio phenotypes).

show correlation of behavioral components in hibrid generation... task to infer most consistent QTL results (chromosome regions explaining phenoptype variation) based on the correlation data 


## Section 2: Nurses and Foragers

Honey bee workers exhibit strong and stable differences in behavior between individuals. Behavioral differences arise as part of a system of age-related, socially regulated division of labor common to species of social insects. During the first 2-3 weeks of adult life, bees exhibit the ***nurse*** phenotype and perform several different tasks in the hive, including brood care. After 3 weeks a bee will generally shift to the ***forager*** phenotype and leave the hive in search of nectar and pollen. The timing of the transition from hive work to foraging is also variable and may be accelerated, delayed, or reversed depending on the needs of the colony. These changes in role are associated with changes in brain structure and neurochemistry.

Individual brain gene expression profiles predict behavioral phenotype between young nurses (YN) and old foragers (OF) from typical bee colonies and experimental colonies.  Expression levels (measured as messenger RNA abundance) are indicated by color scale in which expression ratio (F/N) is average for all foragers and nurses (n = 30 per group). In the absence of old bees, some individuals initiate foraging as much as 2 weeks earlier than usual (*young forager* single cohort). If there are more foragers in the population than normal, some nurses will delay the developmental transition. Individual brain gene expression profiles are shown for age-matched young nurses and young (“precocious”) foragers, and age-matched old foragers and old (“overage”) nurses. Further experiments should help to determine which genes are responding to environmental cues known to be important regulators of behavior, and which genes and pathways cause changes in behavior.

Because foragers are older than nurses in a typical population, examination of bees from typical colonies did not reveal whether gene expression differences are associated with behavior or with age. 


**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: This is a [polyphenism / polymorphism]... why?***

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: The differences between nurse and forager phenotypes can be explained by:  
	a. differences in the genome
	b. differences in the***

## Section 3: Escaping Fish and the Tentacled Snake

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: Which is a selective pressure that maintains c-start behavior in fish?  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)  
a) the need to escape from predators  
b) the speed with which a c-start escape can be accomplished  
c) the need to navigate toward food sources  
d) the predictability of the FAP motor pattern  


**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: What are the neural mechanisms that make the c-start effective as an anti-predator strategy?  
(***Choose all options that are correct*** from the list below. You may choose more than one. You will receive one point off for choosing any that are incorrect)    
a) the Mauthner cell has a large diameter axon   
b) inhibition of the motor neurons on the same side of the body as the activated Mauthner cell  
c) inhibition of the motor neurons on the opposite side of the body as the activated Mauthner cell  
d) Mauthner cell input from sensory filters sensitive to the movement of predators  
e) Mauthner cell input from sensory filters that are activated by all movement in the water  

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: What must be true for c-start escape to exist in fish predated by tentacled snakes?  
(***Choose the one correct option*** from the list below)  
a) the fish predated by tentacled snakes have a less stereotyped c-start behavior (and are therefore less predictable)  
b) the fish have other predators  
c) the fish predated by tentacled snakes respond more slowly to startling stimuli  

**Q ( points; \~ minutes)**: How would you test whether tentacled snake code-breaking is learned through experience or genetically inherited? (It is ok if your proposed experiment has already been done in real life)
