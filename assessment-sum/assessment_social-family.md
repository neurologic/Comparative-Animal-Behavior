You know from the literature that burrowing behavior and parental care behavior are both heritable rather than learned. Now, you want to determine whether mating system phenotypes are genetically linked to parental care phenotypes. Refer to the phylogenetic tree in Figure \___.

Phylogeny and character mapping of Peromyscus species showing known mating, burrowing, and parental care behavioral phenotypes for each species. (Phylogenetic relationships shown to the left of the table)
:::

Use what you know from studies we discussed during the course to briefly outline one experiment that would enable you to distinguish between (and therefore test) the following two alternative hypotheses: 1) that mating behavior and parental care are genetically linked (ie. both are genetically ‘determined,’ but independently), and 2) that mating behavior and parental care are not genetically linked. You can include a cartoon of the experimental design and your comparisons if that helps you describe. Draw a plot/table of the predicted experimental results that would be consistent with the hypothesis that mating and parental care behavior phenotypes are genetically linked (label your plot well). Don’t forget to specify which species from the phylogenetic tree in Figure 7 you are using for your experiment (assume that, in a laboratory environment, you could produce viable offspring from any species pairing in the table.)

**Case Study: Social behavior in Bathyergidae**

There are, broadly, several majore categories of social behavior: solitary, social, and eusocial

:::{glossary}

solitary
	Individuals live and behave alone (except during mating usually)

social
	Individuals group together for some activities, but each maintain reproductive independence. 

eusocial
	Some individuals among the social group give up their own reproductive opportunities to help others reproduce.

Check out the [phylogeny of Bathyergidae on OpenTree](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/opentree13.4@mrcaott45520ott692678/Bathyergidae--Petromuridae). 

Bathyergidae is comprised of 6 Genera: *Heterocephalus, Bathyergus, Fukomys, Cryptomys, Georychus,* and *Heliophobius*. There are only two species among the Bathyergidae family that are eusocial: *Fukomys demarensis* and *Heterocephalus glaber*. 

***Q: How many extant species are within the Bathyergidae family?***

If all extent species from the heliophobius genus are not eusocial, then it is more likely that the LCA of all heliophobius was not eusocial. The same logic applies to Bathyergus, Cryptomys, and Georychus. Likewise, the LCA of all Fukomys was likely not eusocial. To construct the behavior of the LCA for all Bathyergidae, We can consider a 'reduced' tree of all genera within this family.

***Q: Why is the Heterocephalus genus LCA eusocial?***

***Q: Which hypothesis would you reject based on parsimony?***

*Outgroups* can help resolve ambiguity in ancestral state reconstruction.
