[The effect of flock size on vigilance behavior](https://bookdown.org/denajane13/BIONB_2210_Summer_2021/field-lab-4-vigilance-behavior.html)

---

Use continuous focal sampling to investigate whether the proximity of a detected predator influences the activity budget of meerkat behavior. Again, you will consider 'vigilant', 'not vigilant', and 'out of sightâ€™ as the three behaviors comprising the ethogram for this study. Data should be collected for ONE meerkat at each distance of predator presentation (0 m, 2 m, 4 m, 6 m, 8 m, 10 m, 12 m, 14 m). Record the start time of each behaviour on a new line as shown:

| **Behavior** | **Start time** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name of behavior | cummulative seconds | calculated | 


***Q: What behavioral metric (based on your continuous sampling data) do you propose to calculate to test if predator proximity influences the trade-off between vigilant and non vigilant behavior (activity budget)? Define any relevant mathematical equation(s) for your calculation(s).***

Watch [the video clip](https://vimeo.com/77501205) corresponding to the distance you are responsible for and collect your data. 
| distance | start time in video |
| ---| --- | 
| 14m | 0:10 |
| 12m | 3:11 |
| 10m | 6:32 |
| 8m | 9:39 |
| 6m | 12:46 |
| 4m | 15:52 |
| 2m | 18:58 |
| 0m | 22:01 |

***Q: Plot your results.***

***Q: Carry out the same experiment, but use an interval scan sampling method instead. For simplicity, collect data only for the following distances: 14, 10, 6, 2m). Create a figure to clearly report your results. Clearly describe your sampling protocol/method. Define any calculations that you did on the raw data.***

Create an average transition matrix based on your group's analysis of meerkat behavior from class. Combine the data from your group by making a total count of transitions observed (across observers and across animals). Use [this animation template](https://setosa.io/markov/index.html#%7B%22tm%22%3A%5B%5B0.5%2C0.5%5D%2C%5B0.5%2C0.5%5D%5D%7D) to create a visualization of your results. Remember that you will need to change the conditional probabilities in the upper right to reflect your transition matrix. After you have edited the transition probabilities in the animation template to reflect your results, copy the url from the web browser (the url link changes when the probabilities are changed) and paste it below. Report the null hypothesis for your results.
