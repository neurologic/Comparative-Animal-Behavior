Answer all questions either electronically or by hand. Label each of your answers with the corresponding question number. Scan or convert your document to a good quality PDF. Upload to gradescope by the deadline. 


## Section 1: Vigilance in Barnacle Geese

You will observe *vigilance* behavior of barnacle geese (*Branta leucopsis*) by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeJHW5n-PXY). 

**vigilant** is defined (for this experiment) as the animal having it's head up.

Throughout the video, the camera focuses on a single individual. The video is broken up into different experimental bouts. For each bout, the focal goose was among a flock of a different size. 

Go ahead and take a look at the video to get a sense of the way the video is organized and the view you have of the animals while you watch.  

When you watch the video for data collection, you will need to record information that will enable you to calculate (for each experimental condition):
1. the number of times the focal goose is *vigilant* 
2. the percent of time that the focal goose is *vigilant*

Organize a table for data collection that will enable you to calculate both of these quantities without needing to watch the video more than once (mimicking a scenario in which you are observing in real time).

***Q: List all of the information/data that you plan to recorded while you watch the video. Do not include information that you can calculate from your data after you have watched the video.***

Now, organize a data collection table for yourself. Watch the video and use your table to record the data as you watch.

***Q: For one experimental condition, provide a table of the raw data you collected. The table should include only the information that you recorded while observing the geese.***

***Q: (Results 1) Make a scatterplot showing the number of vigilant events for each experimental condition.***

***Q: (Results 2) Make a scatterplot showing the percent of time devoted to vigilance for each experimental condition.***

***Q: This experiment was designed to test the effect of ____________ on _____________ and _______________ in barnacled geese. (Re-write the sentece with the blanks appropriately filled in.***


## Section 2: Vigilance in Meerkats

Like you did in class, you will consider 'vigilant', 'not vigilant', and 'out of sightâ€™ as the three behaviors comprising the ethogram for this study. Data should be collected for ONE meerkat at each distance of predator presentation (2 m, 6 m, 10 m, 14 m). 

***Q: This experiment was designed to test the effect of ______________ on _____________.*** 

### Continuous Focal Sampling 

Record the start time of each behaviour on a new line as shown:

| **Behavior** | **Start time** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name of behavior | cummulative seconds | calculated | 


***Q: What behavioral metric (based on your continuous sampling data) do you propose to calculate to test if predator proximity influences the trade-off between vigilant and non vigilant behavior (activity budget)? Define any relevant mathematical equation(s) for your calculation(s).***

[This video](https://vimeo.com/77501205) is split into time windows according to the following table. 
| distance | start time in video |
| ---| --- | 
| 14m | 0:10 |
| 12m | 3:11 |
| 10m | 6:32 |
| 8m | 9:39 |
| 6m | 12:46 |
| 4m | 15:52 |
| 2m | 18:58 |
| 0m | 22:01 |

For each time window, there was a predator at a different distance ('distance' column in the table). Watch and collect data for only the sections that correspond to predator distances of 14, 10, 6, and 2 meters.   

***Q: Plot your results.***

***Q: How is vigilance behavior being quantified using this sampling method?*** 

### Instantaneous Scan Sampling

Carry out the same experiment, but use an interval scan sampling method instead. For simplicity, collect data only for the following distances: 14, 10, 6, 2m). 

***Q: Create a figure to clearly report your results. Clearly describe your sampling protocol/method. Define any calculations that you did on the raw data.***

***Q: Plot your results.***

***Q: How is vigilance behavior being quantified using this sampling method?*** 


## Section 3: Conditional Probability

It takes a lot of observation hours/days/etc to obtain enough data to estimate a transition matrix for animal behavior. So for this section, you will not be conducting the data collection. Instead, use the provided data to answer the questions. 

for analysis of Observing animals for long enough to 

Create an average transition matrix based on your group's analysis of meerkat behavior from class. Combine the data from your group by making a total count of transitions observed (across observers and across animals). Use [this animation template](https://setosa.io/markov/index.html#%7B%22tm%22%3A%5B%5B0.5%2C0.5%5D%2C%5B0.5%2C0.5%5D%5D%7D) to create a visualization of your results. Remember that you will need to change the conditional probabilities in the upper right to reflect your transition matrix. After you have edited the transition probabilities in the animation template to reflect your results, copy the url from the web browser (the url link changes when the probabilities are changed) and paste it below. Report the null hypothesis for your results.
