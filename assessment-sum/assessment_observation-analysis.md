## Section 1: Vigilance in Barnacle Geese

For this section, you will observe *vigilant* behavior of barnacle geese (*Branta leucopsis*) by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeJHW5n-PXY). You can take a quick look at the video to get a sense of the way the video is organized and the view you will have of the animals, but don't worry about watching in much detail until reading about your experimental tasks. The video starts with some background about the barnacle geese and a bit of an overview about the experiment that you will analyze. The experiment starts at 3min.

**vigilant** is defined (for this experiment) as the animal having it's head up.  
All other behavior can be categorized as "other" or "out of sight" as needed.

Throughout the video, the camera focuses on single geese. The video is broken up into different experimental bouts. For each bout, there is one focal goose. For each bout, the flock size is different. 

When you watch the video for data collection, you will need to record information/data that will enable you to calculate (for each experimental condition):
1. the number of vigilant events per minute (ie. rate) 
2. the percent of time spent *vigilant*

Organize a table for data collection that will enable you to calculate both of these quantities without needing to watch the video more than once (mimicking a scenario in which you are observing in real time). Try to make a plan that is as efficient as possible so that you are not trying to record too much information at the same time.

***Q1: Concisely list and explain the information/data that you plan to record in your data collection table while observing. Do not include information that you can calculate from your data after you have watched the video. (Note that there may be a little bit of variety among correct answers to this question. Just try to be efficient with your data collection and make sure that you will be recording all of the information that you need to complete the two analyses.)***

Now, watch the video and use your table to record the data as you watch.

***Q2: For one experimental condition, provide a table of the raw data you collected. The table should include only the information that you recorded while observing the geese.***

***Q3: Make (and show) a scatterplot of the number of vigilant events per minute for each experimental condition. Was this data that you explicitly recorded while watching; or did you calculate it after? If you did not explicitly record it, how did you calculate the number of vigilant events per minute from the data that you did record?***

***Q4: Make (and show) a scatterplot of the percent of time devoted to vigilance for each experimental condition. Was this data that you explicitly recorded while watching; or did you calculate it after? If you did not explicitly record it, how did you calculate the percent of time spent vigilant from the data that you did record?***

This experiment was designed to test the effect of flock size on vigilance behavior. To test this, vigilant behavior was quantified by treating vigilant behavior as events (1: number of events per minute) and as states (2: percent time).  

***Q5: Based on your results, what conclusion would you draw about the effect of flock size on vigilant behavior? Did both metrics (number of vigilant events per minute and percent time spent vigilant) yield the same conclusion or would your conclusion be different based on which method you used to quantify vigilant behavior? Explain your reasoning. (NOTE: you do not need to do any formal statistics because we did not cover that in class. Just base your answer on the trends you observe in the data.)***

***Q6: You have now had experience with both focal and scan sampling methods. Which did you prefer, and why? (1-4 sentences)***


## Section 2: Activity Budgets and Sequencing

It takes a lot of observation hours/days/etc to obtain enough data to estimate conditional probabilites among actions in an animal's ethogram. So for this section, you will not be conducting the data collection. Instead, use the provided data to answer the questions. 

The following figures are from the paper titled: [Drosophila melanogaster grooming possesses syntax with distinct rules at different temporal scales](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007105)

Grooming in Drosophila melanogaster is characterized by repeated execution of distinct, stereotyped actions. These actions do not always occur in the same order. Mueller et al leverage annotated over 40 hours of video data of flies covered in dust and developed mathematical models (Markov models) to examine action sequencing in D. melanogaster grooming. 

This research group categorized grooming into 5 distinct actions: head (h), front leg (f), abdomen (a), back leg (b), wing (w).

A "dusting" event (the fly gets covered in dust) initiates grooming behavior.

***Q: What is the null hypothesis for the activity budget (percent time) across actions in the grooming ethogram of Drosophila?***

***Q: How do the following results compare to the null hypothesis? List the actions that happen more than expected. List the actions that occur less than expected.***

This research group analyzed the conditional probabilities among grooming actions and reported the following results:

## Section X: Vigilance in Meerkats

Like you did in class, you will consider 'vigilant', 'not vigilant', and 'out of sightâ€™ as the three behaviors comprising the ethogram for this study. Data should be collected for ONE meerkat at each distance of predator presentation (2 m, 6 m, 10 m, 14 m). 

***Q: This experiment was designed to test the effect of ______________ on _____________.*** 

### Continuous Focal Sampling 

Record the start time of each behaviour on a new line as shown:

| **Behavior** | **Start time** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name of behavior | cummulative seconds | calculated | 


***Q: What behavioral metric (based on your continuous sampling data) do you propose to calculate to test if predator proximity influences the trade-off between vigilant and non vigilant behavior (activity budget)? Define any relevant mathematical equation(s) for your calculation(s).***

[This video](https://vimeo.com/77501205) is split into time windows according to the following table. 
| distance | start time in video |
| ---| --- | 
| 14m | 0:10 |
| 12m | 3:11 |
| 10m | 6:32 |
| 8m | 9:39 |
| 6m | 12:46 |
| 4m | 15:52 |
| 2m | 18:58 |
| 0m | 22:01 |

For each time window, there was a predator at a different distance ('distance' column in the table). Watch and collect data for only the sections that correspond to predator distances of 14, 10, 6, and 2 meters.   

***Q: Plot your results.***

***Q: How is vigilance behavior being quantified using this sampling method?*** 

### Instantaneous Scan Sampling

Carry out the same experiment, but use an interval scan sampling method instead. For simplicity, collect data only for the following distances: 14, 10, 6, 2m). 

***Q: Create a figure to clearly report your results. Clearly describe your sampling protocol/method. Define any calculations that you did on the raw data.***

***Q: Plot your results.***

***Q: How is vigilance behavior being quantified using this sampling method?***
