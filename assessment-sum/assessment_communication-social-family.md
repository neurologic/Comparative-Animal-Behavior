You know from the literature that burrowing behavior and parental care behavior are both heritable rather than learned. Now, you want to determine whether mating system phenotypes are genetically linked to parental care phenotypes. Refer to the phylogenetic tree in Figure \___.

Use what you know from studies we discussed during the course to briefly outline one experiment that would enable you to distinguish between (and therefore test) the following two alternative hypotheses: 1) that mating behavior and parental care are genetically linked (ie. both are genetically ‘determined,’ but independently), and 2) that mating behavior and parental care are not genetically linked. You can include a cartoon of the experimental design and your comparisons if that helps you describe. Draw a plot/table of the predicted experimental results that would be consistent with the hypothesis that mating and parental care behavior phenotypes are genetically linked (label your plot well). Don’t forget to specify which species from the phylogenetic tree in Figure 7 you are using for your experiment (assume that, in a laboratory environment, you could produce viable offspring from any species pairing in the table.)
