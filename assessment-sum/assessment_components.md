## Section 1

Herring gull chicks have a stereotyped "begging" behavior. When they are motivated to eat and they see their parent's beak, they peck at the beak. The pecking can induce their parents to regurgitate partially-digested food that they can eat ([though the results are not guaranteed to please](https://youtu.be/a-ek4225__I)). Tinbergen and Perdeck tested a wide variety of herring gull features to deterine the sign stimulus for begging[^tinbergen-gulls-1950]. Examine the results of a small subset of his experiment in Figure 1.

Results from one of Tinbergen's experiments on the begging behavior of herring gulls. The peck rate (purple) toward each of the three stimuli was calculated. The stimulus on the left was the "standard" stimulus meant to mimick multiple features of the adult herring gull head.

***Q: Given the results depicted, which feature does the sign stimulus for gull chick begging depend on? Patch color or head shape?*** 

***Q: What metric was used to quantify begging behavior?***

***Q: How would the level of hunger in a chick effect the peck rate to all of the three stimuli in Figure 1?***

Lorenz model of behavioral expression.

Compare the two contexts (**A** and **B**) in Figure 2 to answer the following questions. 

***Q. Was the stimulus threshold at t=4 higher in A, higher in B, or the same in both A and B?***


***Q. Was the stimulus strength at time=4 stronger in A compared to B or weaker in A compared to B?***
