# Components of Behavior

## Section 1

Herring gull chicks have a stereotyped "begging" behavior. When they are motivated to eat and they see their parent's beak, they peck at the beak. The pecking can induce their parents to regurgitate partially-digested food that they can eat ([though I guess the results are not guaranteed to please](https://youtu.be/a-ek4225__I)). Tinbergen and Perdeck tested a wide variety of herring gull features to deterine the sign stimulus for begging[^tinbergen-gulls-1950]. Examine the results of a small subset of their experiment in Figure 1.

**Figure 1:** Results from one of Tinbergen and Perdeck's experiments on the begging behavior of herring gull chicks. Each of the three stimuli were presented to chicks. The number of pecks directed toward each stimulus was counted and the peck rate (purple) was calculated. The stimulus on the left was the "standard" stimulus meant to mimick multiple features of the adult herring gull head. The standard stimulus serves as the control stimulus in the experiment. Note that the peck rate reported for each stimulus was *normalized* to the standard stimulus (the absolute peck rate for each was divided by the absolute peck rate to the standard stimulus). 

***Q1: What features of the adult herring gull head are being dissociated (and therefore independently tested) in this experiment?***

***Q2: What metric was used to quantify begging behavior in this experiment?***

***Q3: Given the experiment and results depicted:  
		- which single stimulus feature serves as the stronger sign stimulus for gull chick begging (refer to your answer to Q1 for the two stimulus features tested)?  
		- What evidence supports your interpretation?*** 

***Q4: Predict the results of the same experiment if the chicks tested were more hungry. Concisely explain your reasoning.***

Compare the two contexts (**A** and **B**) in Figure 2 to answer the following questions. 

***Q5. Was the stimulus threshold at time=4:    
		- higher in A  
		- higher in B  
		- the same in both A and B  
Choose one of the answers and then briefly explain the evidence and your reasoning.***

***Q6. Was the stimulus strength at time=4:    
		- stronger in A compared to B  
		- weaker in A compared to B  
		- the same in both A and B  
Choose one of the answers and then briefly explain the evidence and your reasoning.***


## Section 3

***Q7: Think (and refer) back to the experiment on stickleback fish aggression that you analyzed and respond to the following:  
		- Which independent stimulus feature that you analyzed was the strongest for eliciting aggression?  
		- Which independent stimulus feature that you analyzed was the weakest for eliciting aggression?   
		- What evidence do you have to support your answers?***

## Section 4

***Q8: Based your observation of the egg-rolling behavior in the videos we watched (see course website for video links) respond to the following:  
		- Pose a hypotheses for what sign stimulus triggers/evokes the FAP of egg-rolling.  
		- What observation(s) led you to formulate that hypothesis?  
		- Briefly describe an experiment that would enable you to gather evidence for/against that hypotheses.  
(Note that there is not going to be one particular answer here. )***
