<p>Herring gull chicks have a stereotyped “begging” behavior. When they
are motivated to eat and they see their parent’s beak, they peck at the
beak. The pecking can induce their parents to regurgitate
partially-digested food that they can eat (<a
href="https://youtu.be/a-ek4225__I">though the results are not
guaranteed to please</a>). Tinbergen and Perdeck tested a wide variety
of herring gull features to deterine the sign stimulus for begging<a

subset of his experiment in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Results from one of Tinbergen’s experiments on the begging behavior
of herring gulls. The peck rate (purple) toward each of the three
stimuli was calculated. The stimulus on the left was the “standard”
stimulus meant to mimick multiple features of the adult herring gull
head. :::</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: Given the results depicted, which feature does the
sign stimulus for gull chick begging depend on? Patch color or head
shape?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What metric was used to quantify begging
behavior?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Q: How would the level of hunger in a chick effect the
peck rate to all of the three stimuli in Figure 1?</em></strong></p>

<p>Lorenz model of behavioral expression. :::</p>
<p>Compare the two contexts (<strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>)
in Figure 2 to answer the following questions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q. Was the stimulus threshold at t=4 higher in A, higher
in B, or the same in both A and B?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Q. Was the stimulus strength at time=4 stronger in A
compared to B or weaker in A compared to B?</em></strong></p>
