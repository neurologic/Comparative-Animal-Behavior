In a study (Herr et al 2017) there was shown to be a relationship between a stress hormone and the defensiveness of a snake. The snake that showed this behavior was the cottonmouth. The fire trials recorded the snakes and obtained blood samples to quantify the plasma CORT concentrations when first encountering another snake and then after 30 minutes. The cottonmouth snakes with a higher baseline of CORT centration were more likely to strike during an initial encounter with a predator than snakes with a lower baseline CORT level. Snakes with lower CORT levels were more likely to engage in threat displays without striking. Other studies
show that animals living in areas with a lot of predators tend to have higher baseline glucocorticoid concentrations. Having these higher hormone baselines set up the animal for fast and anti-predator behavior such as striking. A possible prediction for snake cannibalism could be that a snake has higher hormone levels that set them up to be aggressive and partake in more defensive-type behaviors like combat. The hormones explain why a snake would attack and eat one of its own.

- How does this explanation relate to the Lorenz model of behavior?
- What is the FAP in this example? What is the sign stimulus?
- What does the hormone levels do to the sign stimulus threshold? Draw a plot that relates these two variables.
