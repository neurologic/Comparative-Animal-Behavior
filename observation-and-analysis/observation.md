# Observation

How do we share what we observe and use those observations to define behavior?

## Ethogram Construction

For today, you have already watched [this short video](https://vimeo.com/80600819) and documented all of the distinct behaviors that you observe. 

Now, compare your notes among your group and develop an ethogram including both *behavioral actions* and *definitions for each behavior/action*.

***Q: Please write out your group's final ethogram (behavior names and definitions). Include ‘other’ and ‘out of view’ as two of your behaviors.***

***Q: Were the behaviors that you and your group originally listed different? In what ways? How different?***

## Activity Budgets

How do animals spend their time? Animal behaviorists use ethograms to determine an animal's *activity budget*. 

Now that you have your ethogram of meerkat behavior, you will determine a meerkat activity budget. You will watch a new video of meerkat behavior in which you focus on recording the behavior of a single individual. You will record the start time of each behavior and the behavior name. It is helpful to develop a short code that you can use for each behavior category (e.g. drinking could be denoted with a ‘D’). You can take the initial data using any format you choose (e.g. I used a pen and paper) and you can subsequently enter your data into an electronic spreadsheet if it is helpful for you.

Use the following format for your data record:

| **Behavior** | **Start time** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name of behavior | cummulative seconds | calculated | 

***Q: Which of these columns needs to be filled out during data collection? Which of these columns can be filled out "offline" (after data collection has concluded)?***

***Q: How would you calculate the duration of each instance of each behavior?***

Activity budgets are generally presented as the proportion or percent time that an animal spends in a particular activity. 

***Q: What equation would you use to calcualte the activity budget for each behavior in your ethogram?***

***Q: Would you include or exclude the time spent 'out of sight' in the reported activity budget?***

***Q: Would you include or exclude the time spent doing 'other' behaviors in the reported activity budget?***

In [this 10-minute video](https://vimeo.com/80602697), one meerkat (Bumble) is highlighted throughout. Focus on Bumble's behavior to create a meerkat activity budget. Each person in the group needs to record their own data based on video observation.

***Q: Enter the results of your activity budget calculations here.***

***Q: How would you visually depict/present the activity budget data? Draw a rough sketch (or make an electronic illustration if available to you)***

***Q: How similar or different were your results from your partners?***

## Changing priorities

***Q: Do you think the activity budget is something that is a "constant" for each animal or species or do you think it is something that "varies"? Why? And over what timescale?***

***Q: What might effect an animal's activity budget?***

***Q: Pose at least two alternate hypotheses about meerkat behavior and predictions of those hypotheses that could be tested by calculating and comparing activity budgets under different experimental conditions.***
