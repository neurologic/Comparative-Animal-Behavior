From [denajane13's bookdown](https://bookdown.org/denajane13/BIONB_2210_Summer_2021/field-lab-2-ethograms-and-activity-budgets.html#part-1.-build-an-ethogram-from-meerkat-observations)

Your first task will be to watch [this short video](https://vimeo.com/80600819). While you watch the video, document all of the different behaviors that you observe. After you watch the video, develop an ethogram with your partner including: a) behavioral categories and b) definitions for each category.

Question 1a. Were the behaviors that you and your partner listed different? Question 1b. Please enter your ethogram (behavioral categories and definitions) here. Make sure to include ‘other’ and ‘out of view’ as two of your categories.

Part 3. Focal sampling and inter-observer reliability
Now, both you and your partner will watch this 10-minute focal video of one meerkat (Bumble) https://vimeo.com/80602697. You will want to develop a short code that you can use for each behavior category (e.g. drinking could be denoted with a ‘D’). You will want to note the start time of each behavior and the behavior code. You can take the initial data using any format you choose (e.g. I used a pen and paper) and you can subsequently enter your data into the spreadsheet.

Question 2. How similar or different were your observations to your partners?

Part 4. Calculating activity budgets using focal data
Activity budgets are used to provide information about how animals spend their time. They are generally presented as the proportion or percent time that an animal spends in a particular activity. They are important for providing baseline data on animal behavior, and can be used for testing hypotheses related to different experimental treatments. To calculate meerkat activity budgets use the following steps:

Calculate the number of seconds engaged in each entry on data sheet.
Sum up total number of seconds for each behavior
Divide the total number of seconds engaged in behavior by the total number of seconds of observation (in this case 600).
Then multiply each value by 100 to report your activity budget in percent
Question 3. Enter the results of your activity budget calculations here.
