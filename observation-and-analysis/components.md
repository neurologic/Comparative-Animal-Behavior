## Fundamental Units of Behavior and their expression

What is behavior? In order to study animal behavior as a scientific community, we need to define an animal's behavior in an objective way. The ways in which we define behavior must be at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale for our level of analysis (ultimate versus proximate, neural versus genetic, etc).

***Q: Think of an animal you are familiar with. Describe what you think is a 'fundamental unit' of that animal's behavior. ('fundamental unit' = the smallest chunk of behavior that can be defined as a specific behavior)***

***Q: What timescale do fundamental units of behavior generally occur over?***

***Q: What is the longest timescale that you can think of for a common behavior?***

***Q: Think of an animal you are familiar with and a common behavior that you have seen that animal do. What is the behavior? During that behavior, is the animal always doing the same movement? Or is the behavior comprised of a variety of movements?***

### Movemes, Actions, Activities

The hierarchical nature of behavior is clear, despite a lack of concensus for terminology used to describe its component parts[^AndersonPerona2014][^Datta2019].

[^AndersonPerona2014]: David J.Anderson and Pietro Perona [Toward a Science of Computational Ethology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.005). Neuron 84:1 (2014).

[^Datta2019]: Datta SR, Anderson DJ, Branson K, Perona P, Leifer A [Computational Neuroethology: A Call to Action](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.09.038). Neuron 104:11-24 (2019). 

The following language defined by Anderson and Perona[^AndersonPerona2014] provides a reasonable basis for  discussion. 

:::{glossary}

Moveme  
	The simplest meaningful pattern associated with a behavior. Typically involves a short, ballistic trajectory described by a verb, such as a turn, a step, or a wing extension, which cannot be further decomposed. It is analogous to a “phoneme” in language.

Action  
	A combination of movemes that always occurs in the same stereotypical sequence and that is also described by a verb. Examples of actions include “walk” (step + step + step), “assess threat” (stop + stand up on hind legs + sniff), “eat” (open mouth + bite + chew + swallow), etc. In language, it would be analogous to a word or to an idiomatic expression.

Activity  
	A species-characteristic concatenation of actions and movemes whose structure is typical, ranging from stereotyped to variable. Variability can be observed both in the structure or dynamics of the individual actions that comprise an activity, as well as in the timing and/or sequence of the actions. Examples of activities include courtship, aggression, nest-building, parenting, etc.

"A characteristic sequence of behaviors exhibited by a mouse in its home cage as it moves around the walls (thigmotaxis), approaches some food, eats, and then sleeps (center, mouse cartoons). Several key challenges facing any segmentation of continuous behavior into components are illustrated. Behaviors need to be labeled, which raises the problem of ‘‘lumping’’ versus ‘‘splitting’’ (red); for example, mice engage in thigmotaxis, behaviors in which the mouse exhibits locomotion and turning behaviors that are deterministically sequenced to generate an action where the animal circumnavigates its cage. Is thigmotaxis a singular or unitary behavior (because its elements are deterministically linked during its expression), or it is a sequence of walking, turning, and walking behaviors? Should behavior be considered at a single timescale that serially progresses or instead considered a hierarchical process organized at multiple timescales simultaneously (blue)? When the mouse is sniffing and running at the same time, is that a compositional behavior whose basis set includes ‘‘run’’ and ‘‘sniff,’’ or is ‘‘running+sniffing’’ a fundamentally new behavior (purple)?"[^Datta2019]

### Fixed Action Pattern (FAP)[^instinctive-motor-pattern][^fap]

[^instinctive-motor-pattern]: In *Here am I. Where are You?* (1988), Lorenz uses the term 'instinctive motor pattern' instead.

[^fap]: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_action_pattern)

:::{index} fixed action patterns
:::

***Q: How does Lorenz define a FAP?***

***Q: In the case of complex FAPs involving a series of different movements, how can we decide whether we are dealing with a single FAP or a series of different ones?***

### Releasing Mechanisms and Sign Stimuli

:::{index} sign stimuli
:::

***Q: How did Lorenz determine the sign stimulus for aggression in stickleback fish?***

Pecking behavior for regurgitation.
Design a set of stimuli to determine what the sign stimulus is. 


### Action-Specific Potential (ASP; Energy)

:::{index} action specific potential
:::

***Q: Define 'spontaneous.'***

***Q: Define 'appetitive.'***


Graph how ASP changes over time for a behavior
How does the presence of a sign stimulus change the ASP
what happens to ASP once it reaches threshold?
how is the stimulus strength needed to elicit related to the internal drive and behavioral threshold?

### Motivation

What is motivation? How do we determnine the motivation of an animal?

(day2)=
## Complexities of behavior

### Ritualization

The evolution of new behaviors for old motivations

### Superpositions

Source of error for determining the motivation of an animal. 

### Learning

Imprinting 
Associative
Operant


### Exploitation

Stereotyped = Predictable
Code breaking of stereotyped actions/responses. must mimic sign stimulus
