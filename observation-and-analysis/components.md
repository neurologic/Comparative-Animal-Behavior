## Fundamental units of behavior and their stimulation

:::{admonition} Why?
In order to study animal behavior as a scientific community, we need to categorize and define an animal behavior in an objective way. The ways in which we define behavior for a particular study must be at an appropriate organizational level and an appropriate timescale for our level of analysis and our question (ultimate versus proximate, neural versus genetic, etc).

### Fundamental units of ...

All living organisms are made up of cells. 

***Q: How many different types of cells can you think of?***

Cells are considered the *fundamental unit* of life. You can use this model from biology to explore the analagous concept in the study of animal behavior.

***Q: How many levels of organization would you split behavior into? Create a name for, and describe, each level. It can help to think of an animal and some of its behavior to use as an example of your categorization and organization.***

***Q: In your model, what are the fundamental units of behavior? Provide some examples.***

***Q: What timescale do you think that fundamental units of behavior generally occur over?***

***Q: What is the longest timescale that you can think of for something that you would define as an animal behavior?***

### Movemes, Actions, Activities

The *levels of organization* that you explored in the last sections are an example of *hierarchy*. The hierarchical nature of behavior is clear, despite a lack of concensus for terminology used to describe its component parts[^AndersonPerona2014][^Datta2019].

[^AndersonPerona2014]: David J.Anderson and Pietro Perona [Toward a Science of Computational Ethology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.09.005). Neuron 84:1 (2014).

[^Datta2019]: Datta SR, Anderson DJ, Branson K, Perona P, Leifer A [Computational Neuroethology: A Call to Action](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.09.038). Neuron 104:11-24 (2019). 

***Q: What does 'hierarchy' mean?***

The following language defined by Anderson and Perona[^AndersonPerona2014] provides a reasonable basis for discussion. 

:::{glossary}

Moveme  
	The simplest meaningful pattern associated with a behavior. Typically involves a short, ballistic trajectory described by a verb, such as a turn, a step, or a wing extension, which cannot be further decomposed. It is analogous to a “phoneme” in language.

Action  
	A combination of movemes that always occurs in the same stereotypical sequence and that is also described by a verb. Examples of actions include “walk” (step + step + step), thigmotaxis (walk + turn + walk), etc. In language, it would be analogous to a word or to an idiomatic expression.

Activity  
	A species-characteristic concatenation of actions and movemes whose structure is typical, ranging from stereotyped to variable. Variability can be observed both in the structure or dynamics of the individual actions that comprise an activity, as well as in the timing and/or sequence of the actions. Examples of activities include nest-building, parenting, etc.

:::

The following figure presents these concepts in the context of several issues that we need to grapple with in the study of animal behavior. 

:::{figure-md} DattaBehaviorHierarchy
:class: figure

<img src="/images/Datta_2019-ChallengesOfDefiningBehavior.png" alt="fishy" class="bg-primary mb-1" width="700px">

A characteristic sequence of behaviors exhibited by a mouse in its home cage as it moves around the walls (thigmotaxis), approaches some food, eats, and then sleeps (center, mouse cartoons). Several key challenges facing any segmentation of continuous behavior into components are illustrated. Behaviors need to be labeled, which raises the problem of ‘‘lumping’’ versus ‘‘splitting’’ (red); for example, mice engage in thigmotaxis, behaviors in which the mouse exhibits locomotion and turning behaviors that are deterministically sequenced to generate an action where the animal circumnavigates its cage. Is thigmotaxis a singular or unitary behavior (because its elements are deterministically linked during its expression), or it is a sequence of walking, turning, and walking behaviors? Should behavior be considered at a single timescale that serially progresses or instead considered a hierarchical process organized at multiple timescales simultaneously (blue)? When the mouse is sniffing and running at the same time, is that a compositional behavior whose basis set includes ‘‘run’’ and ‘‘sniff,’’ or is ‘‘running+sniffing’’ a fundamentally new behavior (purple)?[^Datta2019]
:::

***Q: Pick an animal that you are familiar with (do not spend too much time deliberating over which animal to use). Make an example behavior hierarchy for that animal that spans the activity to moveme levels (do not include all behavior of the animal, just enough to make an example hierarchy of behavior). Think about effective ways to present a hierarchy in developing your response. Include definitions of each component of its behavior that you include. (Do not use any of the examples already given in the figure text).***

### Fixed Action Pattern (FAP)[^instinctive-motor-pattern][^fap], Releasing Mechanisms, and Sign Stimuli

[^instinctive-motor-pattern]: In *Here am I. Where are You?* (1988), Lorenz uses the term 'instinctive motor pattern' instead.

[^fap]: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_action_pattern)

:::{index} fixed action patterns
:::

:::{admonition} Why?
You can observe and categorize an animal's behavior at any moment in time. But what is that animal *not* doing at that moment in time? Why? What causes a particular behavior to emerge from the behavioral bag of tricks that animal has inherited?
:::

A standard example of FAPs given in introductory animal behavior courses, is egg rolling. Female gulls sit on their eggs in the nest to incubate them. Sometimes, the eggs roll out of the nest. The gull, noticing an egg outside of the nest, performs an 'egg rolling' behavior in response. As a class, let's watch these two videos of egg rolling:
- [egg rolling video 1](https://youtu.be/7PcteKRA3zs)
- [egg rolling video 2](https://youtu.be/vUNZv-ByPkU)

Because the gull's egg rolling behavior is *stereotyped*, you can define it. Behaviors like these are often categorized as *fixed action patterns* (FAP)[^FAPdefinition]. 

[^FAPdefinition]: Historically, behaviors are considered FAPs when they are *instinctual* (ie. genetically-determined and *pre-programmed*). In a more contemporary mindset, we can think of *behavioral patterns* that need not be purely *pre-programmed* (as you will learn in this course if you have not already... no behavior truly is).

***Q: Based on the video, define the gull 'egg rolling' behavior 'objectively'.***

***Q: What do you think the function of egg rolling behavior is?***

***Q: What else do you notice in these example videos of egg rolling behavior? List comments and questions that you have.***


:::{index} sign stimuli
:::

Another standard examples of FAPs given in introductory animal behavior courses, is territorial aggression in stickleback fish[^intro-stickleback]. During the breeding season, the male fish select a territory on which they build a nest. When a male stickleback spots another nearby male in his nesting territory, he will launch into a FAP involving aggressive displays designed to scare off the stranger. However, males are not aggressive to nearby females in their territory.

Stickleback fish appearance. Top: female. Bottom: male.
:::

***Q: What differences do you notice between the appearance of males and females?***

***Q: If aggressive FAPs should only be elicited by the presence of other males, what sensory cues could be used to appropriately trigger the FAPs?***


A *bite* is a component of aggression and can be defined as *contact of the male's mouth against an object*. *Bite rate* can then be used to quantify aggression.

***Q: Mathematically define 'bite rate' (how would you calculate it?).***

[^intro-stickleback]: For example, see the landing page for 'innate behavior' from [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/ecology-ap/responses-to-the-environment/a/innate-behaviors). However, note that the reference for this result is a textbook, not [the original article](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1938-03659-001). The data from the [publication in German](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01422.x) is not available. Based on replications of the original experiments, it turns out that [Tinbergen's results from the 1937 paper may be less clear](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534445#metadata_info_tab_contents). 

***Q: Would a male stickleback fish's bite rate be higher in the presence of another male or another female?***

Lorenz's model of FAP release. A sign stimulus is presented at time = 7.5au. 
:::

***Q: What variables are represented in Lorenz' model of behavior?***

***Q: What data is being depicted in the top 2-D plot?***

***Q: What data is being depicted in the bottom 1-D plot?***

***Q: What happens to action specific potential (aka action specific energy) across time?***

***Q: How does the data in the bottom plot relate to the data in the top plot?***

***Q: How would you define the green horizontal line in the top plot using any or all of the following terms: action specific energy, time, and/or FAP expression?***

***Q: In the top plot, what is different about the line that starts at time=6au from the lines that start at 0, 3, and 7.5?***

***Q: In the bottom plot, what is different about the third FAP observed compared to the first, second, and fourth?***

***Q: Based on the information given in the model and your work so far, what does a sign stimulus do for FAPs?***

***Q: Based on the information given in the model and your work so far, what happens with FAPs in the absence of a sign stimulus?***

***Q: According to the data in the figure, what is the rate at which action-specific energy increases in the absence of any sign stimulus.***

We would call this the *spontaneous* increase (as opposed to stimulus-driven increase).

We can think of action-specific energy as *internal drive* or *motivation* for a particular behavior (FAP). 

***Q: How is the stimulus strength needed to elicit a FAP related to the current state of motivation and the threshold for that FAP (in terms of energy)?***

The *strength* of a stimulus is defined in terms of how much it increases action-specific energy. 

***Q: Think (and refer) back to the experiment in stickleback fish that you analyzed. Which stimulus was the strongest? Which stimulus was the weakest? What evidence do you have to support your answers?***

***Q: Complete this sentence by selecting one of the options: The more motivated an animal is toward a specific FAP, the ( stronger / weaker ) the stimulus needs to be to elicit the FAP.***

## Complexities of behavior

***Q: In the case of complex FAPs involving a series of different movements, how do you think we can decide whether we are dealing with a single FAP or a series of different ones?***

:::{admonition} Why?
At each moment in time, only one behavior can occur. Therefore, each possible behavior is competing with all other behaviors. To complicate our analysis, behaviors happen over time. And different behaviors occur over different durations/timescales.
:::

Lorenz names several complexities that make it difficult to understand the motivation of an animal based on its behavior and even to understand the behavior itself. Ritualization, superposition, and learning are examples of behavioral phenomena that become sources of error for determining the motivation of an animal. 

***Q: Review, compare, and synthesize your summaries of: 'ritualization, superposition, and learning' with your group.***

### Ritualization

***Q: Create your group's summary of ritualization.***

### Superpositions

***Q: Create your group's summary of superposition.***

***Q: How is the issue of 'superposition' of behavior different from or similar to the issue of 'hierarchy' of behavior?***

### Learning

For example, *imprinting*.

***Q: Create your group's summary of superposition.***

***Q: How could behavioral learning make it difficult to identify species-specific FAPs?***
