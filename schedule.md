| **Jan 30** | Welcome and Introduction | none | [](../welcome); <br> [](../syllabus); <br> Tinbergen's Four Analyses; <br> Groups |

| Feb 8 | Observation | Complete the [data analysis and questions on Stickleback aggression](stickleback-aggression-analysis) from last class; <br> Complete the [question about stickleback action specific potential](stickleback-aggression-lorenz-model) from last class; <br> Read [this editorial about Margaret Morse](https://theconversation.com/margaret-morse-nice-thought-like-a-song-sparrow-and-changed-how-scientists-understand-animal-behavior-123734); <br> Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/80600819) and name&define 3-5 distinct behaviors that you observe | [](../observation-and-analysis/observation) |
| **Feb 13** | Analysis | [Altmann 1973 *Sampling Methods*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4533591) <br> Focus your attention on understanding *continuous* versus *interval* and *scan* versus *focal* methods (so sections **V** and **IX**) because these are the methods we will implement in class. The Introduction (**I**) and Sampling Variables (**II**) sections discuss concepts we have already touched on in class so are good to read for review. For all other sections, I would recommend skimming them enough to get a sense of the method (enough to write a one sentence summary/reminder for future you that comes back to the document for reference). This paper is a heavily used and cited reference for sampling methods in animal behavior research overall. | [](../observation-and-analysis/analysis) |
